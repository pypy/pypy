PyPy: Python in Python implementation 
======================================

Welcome to PyPy!

PyPy is both an implementation of the Python programming language, and
an extensive compiler framework for dynamic language implementations.
You can build self-contained Python implementations which execute
independently from CPython.

We invite you to head over to our detailed getting-started document:

    pypy/doc/getting-started.html or
    pypy/doc/getting-started.txt
    (local if you got a tarball or svn checkout)

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html

which gives you many good starting and entry points into playing with
PyPy.  It will also point you to our documentation section which is
generated from information in the pypy/doc directory.

Enjoy and send us feedback!

    the pypy-dev team <pypy-dev@codespeak.net>
