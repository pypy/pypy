"""Module pytokenize

THIS FILE WAS COPIED FROM pypy/module/parser/pytokenize.py AND ADAPTED
TO BE ANNOTABLE (Mainly made lists homogeneous)

This is a modified version of Ka-Ping Yee's tokenize module found in the
Python standard library.

The primary modification is the removal of the tokenizer's dependence on the
standard Python regular expression module, which is written in C.  The regular
expressions have been replaced with hand built DFA's using the
basil.util.automata module.
