==================================
Getting started with PyPy
==================================

PyPy sources can be browsed on the web at:

    ``http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/trunk/``

Once you are ready to download and try PyPy out,
follow these instructions, which assume that you
are working in a DOS box (Windows) or terminal (MacOS/X or Linux).

1. Download subversion_ if you do not already have it.


2. Change to the directory where you wish to install the source tree,
   and use subversion to download the source::

        svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist

   This will create a subdirectory named ``src``, and will create
   the PyPy source tree under this directory.


   If desired, you can also download the documentation::
   
        svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc

   
3. To start interpreting Python with PyPy, use Python 2.3 or greater::

        cd src/pypy/interpreter
        python py.py

   After a few seconds, you should be at the PyPy prompt, which is
   the same as the Python prompt, but with an extra ">".


4. Now you are ready to start running Python code.  Some real Python
   modules will not run yet, and others will run too slowly to be
   worth waiting for, but a few are fun to run::
   
        >>>> import pystone
        >>>> pystone.main(10)

   Note that this is a slightly modified version of pystone -- the
   original version does not accept the parameter to main().  The
   parameter is the number of loops to run through the test, and the
   default is 50000, which is far too many to run in a reasonable time
   on the current PyPy implementation.


5. To list the PyPy interpreter command line options, type::

        python py.py --help

   As an example of using PyPy from the command line, you could type::

        python py.py -c "import pystone; pystone.main(10)"

   Alternatively, as with regular Python, you can simply give a
   script name on the command line::

        python py.py ../appspace/pystone.py

   (Note that this will run "forever" -- actually, "just" for many
   hours, with the current implementation of PyPy.)


6. The PyPy project uses test-driven-development.  Right now, there are
   a couple of different categories of tests which you can run.
   To run all the unit tests::

        cd src/pypy
        python test_all.py

   Alternatively, you may run subtests by going to the correct subdirectory
   and running them individually::

        cd src/pypy/module/test
        python test_builtin.py

   Finally, there are some more advanced tests (which are derived from
   some of the standard CPython tests).  These are not part of the unit
   tests, because they take longer than the standard unit tests::

        cd src/pypy/interpreter
        python py.py ../appspace/builtin_types_test.py


Trying out the translator
=========================

The translator is a tool based on the PyPy interpreter which can translate
sufficiently static Python programs into low-level code.

1. Download and install `Dot Graphviz`_.

2. Download and install Pygame_ if you do not already have it.

3. Type::

        cd src/pypy/translator
        python -i translator.py

   Test snippets of translatable code are provided in the file
   ``test/snippet.py``.  For example::

        >>> t = Translator(test.is_perfect_number)
        >>> t.simplify()
        >>> t.view()

4. We have a type annotator that can completely infer types for functions like
   ``is_perfect_number``::

        >>> t.annotate([int])
        >>> t.view()

   Move the mouse over variable names (in red) to see their inferred types.

5. The graph can be turned into Pyrex code, with types if ``annotate()`` was
   called::

        >>> print t.pyrex()
        >>> f = t.compile()
        >>> f(28)
        1

   Note how the strange-looking Pyrex code is unrelated to the original
   Python source code.  This is because the Pyrex code is generated from the
   graph only, without reference to the original source.


Where to start reading the sources
==================================

PyPy is made from parts that are relatively independent from each other.
You should start looking at the part that attracts you most:

*  `src/pypy/interpreter`_ contains the basic interpreter: bytecode dispatcher
   in pyopcode.py_, frame and code objects in eval.py_ and pyframe.py_,
   function objects and argument passing in function.py_ and argument.py_,
   the object space interface definition in baseobjspace.py_, modules in
   module.py_ and extmodule.py_.  Core types supporting the interpreter are
   defined in typedef.py_.

*  `src/pypy/objspace/std`_ contains the `Standard object space`_.  The main file
   is objspace.py_.  For each type, the files ``xxxtype.py`` and
   ``xxxobject.py`` contain respectively the definition of the type and its
   (default) implementation.

*  `src/pypy/objspace`_ contains a few other object spaces: the trivial one
   (but let's forget about it), the trace_ one, the flow_ one.  The latter
   is a relatively short piece of code that builds the control flow graphs
   when the interpreter runs in it.

*  `src/pypy/translator`_ contains the code analysis and generation stuff.
   Start reading from translator.py_, from which it should be easy to follow
   the pieces of code involved in the various translation phases.

*  `src/pypy/annotation`_ contains the data model for the type annotation that
   can be inferred about a graph.  The graph "walker" that uses this is in
   `src/pypy/translator/annrpython.py`_.


To learn more
=============

*  To learn more about PyPy and its development process, read the documentation_
   and the wiki_, and consider subscribing to the `mailing lists`_ (or simply
   read the archives online) or communicating via irc.freenode.net:6667, channel #pypy.

*  To help PyPy become Python-the-next-generation, write some `unit tests`_ and
   file some `bug reports`_!
