Just the facts 
============== 

getting & running the PyPy 0.6 release 
---------------------------------------

Download one of the following release files and unpack it: 

*pypy-0.6 (not released yet)*
    
    * download `pypy-0.6.zip` or `pypy-0.6.tar.gz` and unpack it 
    
    * alternatively run ``svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/tag/0.6 pypy-0.6`` 

then change to the ``pypy-0.6`` directory
and execute the following command line:: 

    python pypy/bin/py.py 

This will give you a PyPy prompt, i.e. a very compliant 
Python interpreter implemented in Python.  Because this version
of PyPy still runs on top of CPython, it runs around 3000-4000
times slower than the original CPython.  The 0.6 release focus 
really was on compliancy: PyPy passes around `90% of CPythons core 
language regression tests`_. 

Have a look at `interesting starting points`_ 
for guidance on how to continue. 

.. _`90% of CPythons core language regression tests`: http://codespeak.net/~hpk/pypy-testresult/ 

Svn-check out & run the latest PyPy as a two-liner
--------------------------------------------------

If you want to play with the ongoing development PyPy version 
you can check it out from the repository using subversion. Download 
and install subversion_ if you don't allready have it. Then you can
issue on the command line (DOS box or terminal)::

    svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist pypy-dist 

This will create a directory named ``pypy-dist``, and will get you the PyPy
source in ``pypy-dist/pypy`` and documentation files in
``pypy-dist/pypy/documentation``.

After checkout you can get a PyPy interpreter via:: 

    python pypy-dist/pypy/bin/py.py

have fun :-) 

We have some `help on installing subversion`_ for PyPy. 
Have a look at `interesting starting points`_ 
for some guidance on how to continue. 

.. _`help on installing subversion`: svn-help.html

Understanding PyPy's architecture
---------------------------------

For in-depth information about architecture and coding documentation 
head over to the `documentation section`_ where you'll find lots of 
interesting information.  Additionally, in true hacker spirit, you 
may just `start reading sources`_ . 

.. _`documentation section`: index.html 

running all of PyPy's tests  
---------------------------

If you want to see if PyPy works on your machine/platform 
you can simply run PyPy's large test suite with:: 

    python pypy/test_all.py 

test_all.py is just another name for `py.test`_ which is the
testing tool that we are using and enhancing for PyPy.   

.. _`py.test`: http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html 

Filing bugs or feature requests 
-------------------------------

You may file `bug reports`_ on our issue tracker which is
also accessible through the 'issues' top menu of 
the PyPy website.  `using the development tracker`_ has 
more detailed information on specific features of the tracker. 

.. _`using the development tracker`: coding-guide.html#using-development-tracker

.. _`interesting starting points`: 

Interesting Starting Points in PyPy 
===================================

The following assumes that you have successfully downloaded and exctracted the
PyPy release or have checked out PyPy using svn. It assumes that you are in
the top level directory of the PyPy source tree, e.g. pypy-x.x (if you
got a release) or pypy-dist (if you checked out the most recent version using
subversion).

Main entry point / special PyPy features 
------------------------------------------

1. To start interpreting Python with PyPy, use Python 2.3 or greater::

        cd pypy/bin
        python py.py

   After a few seconds (remember: this is running on top of CPython), 
   you should be at the PyPy prompt, which is the same as the Python 
   prompt, but with an extra ">".

2. Now you are ready to start running Python code.  Most Python
   modules should work if they don't involve CPython extension 
   modules.  Here is an example of determining PyPy's performance 
   in pystones:: 
   
        >>>> from test import pystone 
        >>>> pystone.main(10)

   Note that this is a slightly modified version of pystone -- the
   original version does not accept the parameter to main().  The
   parameter is the number of loops to run through the test, and the
   default is 50000, which is far too many to run in a reasonable time
   on the current PyPy implementation.


3. There are a few extra features of the PyPy console: If you press
   <Ctrl-C> on the console you enter the interpreter-level console, a
   usual CPython console.  You can then access internal objects of PyPy
   (e.g. the object space) and any variables you have created on the PyPy
   prompt with the affix ``w_``:: 

        >>>> a = 123
        >>>> <Ctrl-C>
        *** Entering interpreter-level console ***
        >>> w_a
        W_IntObject(123)

   Note that the prompt of the interpreter-level console is only '>>>' since
   it runs on CPython level. To return to PyPy, press <Ctrl-D>.

4. You can also use the trace object space to trace the work of the
   interpreter. To enable it, do on the PyPy console::

        >>>> __pytrace__ = 1
        Tracing enabled
        >>>> a = 1 + 2
        |-<<<<<enter <inline>a = 1 + 2 @ 1>>>>>>>
        |- 0    LOAD_CONST    0 (W_IntObject(1))
        |- 3    LOAD_CONST    1 (W_IntObject(2))
        |- 6    BINARY_ADD
          |-                 >> add(W_IntObject(1), W_IntObject(2))
          |-                    add =: W_IntObject(3)
        |- 7    STORE_NAME    0 (a)
          |-                 >> setitem(globals(), W_StringObject('a'), W_IntObject(3))
          |-                    setitem =: <W_NoneObject()>
        |-10    LOAD_CONST    2 (<W_NoneObject()>)
        |-13    RETURN_VALUE
        |-<<<<<leave <inline>a = 1 + 2 @ 1>>>>>>>


5. To list the PyPy interpreter command line options, type::

        cd pypy/bin
        python py.py --help

   As an example of using PyPy from the command line, you could type::

        python py.py -c "from test import pystone; pystone.main(10)"

   Alternatively, as with regular Python, you can simply give a
   script name on the command line::

        python py.py ../../lib-python/modified-2.3.4/test/pystone.py 10


6. One of the original features provided by the py.py interpreter that are
   without equivalent in CPython is the "thunk" object space, providing
   lazily-computed objects::

        cd pypy/bin
        python py.py -o thunk

        >>>> def longcomputation(lst):
        ....     print "computing..."
        ....     return sum(lst)
        .... 
        >>>> x = thunk(longcomputation, range(5))
        >>>> y = thunk(longcomputation, range(10))
        >>>> d = {5: x, 10: y}
        >>>> result = d[5]
        >>>> result
        computing...
        10
        >>>> type(d[10])
        computing...
        <type 'int'>
        >>>> d[10]
        45

   You will find more examples in the directory ``demo``.


7. The PyPy project uses test-driven-development.  Right now, there are
   a couple of different categories of tests which you can run.
   To run all the unit tests::

        cd pypy
        python test_all.py

   Alternatively, you may run subtests by going to the correct subdirectory
   and running them individually::

        python test_all.py module/test/test_builtin.py

   ``test_all.py`` is actually just a synonym for `py.test`_ which is 
   our external testing tool. If you have installed that then you 
   can as well just issue ``py.test DIRECTORY_OR_FILE`` in order 
   to perform test runs or simply start it without arguments to 
   run all tests below the current directory. 

   Finally, there are standard regression tests which you can 
   run like this::

        cd lib-python-2.3.4/test 
        python ../../pypy/test_all.py -E

   or if you have `installed py.test`_ then you simply say::

        py.test -E

   from the lib-python-2.3.4/test directory. 

.. _`installed py.test`: http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/getting_started.html


Trying out the translator
------------------------- 

The translator is a tool based on the PyPy interpreter which can translate
sufficiently static Python programs into low-level code.

1. Download and install `Dot Graphviz`_.

2. Download and install Pygame_ if you do not already have it.

3. Type::

        cd pypy/translator
        python -i translator.py

   Test snippets of translatable code are provided in the file
   ``test/snippet.py``.  For example::

        >>> t = Translator(test.is_perfect_number)
        >>> t.view()
        
.. >>> from pypy.translator.translator import Translator 
.. >>> from pypy.translator.test import snippet as test 

4. We have a type annotator that can completely infer types for functions like
   ``is_perfect_number``::

        >>> a = t.annotate([int])
        >>> t.view()

   Move the mouse over variable names (in red) to see their inferred types. To
   perform simplifications based on the annotation you can do::

        >>> a.simplify()

5. The graph can be turned into C code::

       >>> a.specialize()
       >>> f = t.ccompile()

   The first command replaces operations with variables of types that are
   avaiable in C (e.g. int) with low level versions. This can be ommited if no
   annotation (step 4) has been performed.

6. If you feel adventureous (and have LLVM installed and on your path) you can
   also try to compile the graph with LLVM. This is still quite experimental
   and only works with some functions: One of the most visible restriction is
   that return type of the entry function has to be and int, float or bool. To
   try it do::

       >>> print t.llvm()
       >>> f = t.llvmcompile(optimize=True)
       >>> f(28)
       1

   This works only with fully annotated graphs.


.. _`start reading sources`: 
   
Where to start reading the sources
---------------------------------- 

PyPy is made from parts that are relatively independent from each other.
You should start looking at the part that attracts you most (all parts are
relative to the PyPy toplevel directory):

*  `pypy/interpreter`_ contains the basic interpreter: bytecode dispatcher
   in pyopcode.py_, frame and code objects in eval.py_ and pyframe.py_,
   function objects and argument passing in function.py_ and argument.py_,
   the object space interface definition in baseobjspace.py_, modules in
   module.py_ and mixedmodule.py_.  Core types supporting the interpreter are
   defined in typedef.py_.

*  `pypy/objspace/std`_ contains the `Standard object space`_.  The main file
   is objspace.py_.  For each type, the files ``xxxtype.py`` and
   ``xxxobject.py`` contain respectively the definition of the type and its
   (default) implementation.

*  `pypy/objspace`_ contains a few other object spaces: the thunk_
   one, the trace_ one, the flow_ one.  The latter is a relatively short piece
   of  code that builds the control flow graphs when the interpreter runs in it.

*  `pypy/translator`_ contains the code analysis and generation stuff.
   Start reading from translator.py_, from which it should be easy to follow
   the pieces of code involved in the various translation phases.

*  `pypy/annotation`_ contains the data model for the type annotation that
   can be inferred about a graph.  The graph "walker" that uses this is in
   `pypy/translator/annrpython.py`_.


To learn more
------------- 

* To learn more about PyPy and its development process,  
  read around in the documentation_ and consider 
  subscribing to the `mailing lists`_ (or simply
  read the archives online) 
  
* show up on irc.freenode.net:6667, channel #pypy and ask
  questions.  The logs of the channel can be found at 
  http://nimrod.terra-link.net/pypy/_.

* To help PyPy become Python-the-next-generation, you 
  are invited to participate in its development.

Additional Tools for running (and hacking) PyPy 
-----------------------------------------------

We use some optional tools for working on pypy. They are not required to run 
the basic tests or to get an interactive PyPy prompt but they help to
understand  and debug PyPy especially for the ongoing translation work.  

Recommended tools 
+++++++++++++++++

*graphviz* 

	(used for visualizing the control-flow)
	http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html 

*pygame*

	(to visualize control flow and annotation analysis of python programs)
	http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Optional tools 
++++++++++++++ 

*llvm* 

    (used for the optional LLVM translation backend)
    One of our backends uses the `low level virtual machine`_ to generate
    processor independant machine level code.

    LLVM can be quite annoying to install: you need a fairly recent version of
    GCC to compile it and there can be severe problems under windows. There are
    detailed instructions on `how to install LLVM`_. To use the LLVM backend
    you don't need the GCC front end of LLVM, only LLVM itself. If you run
    into problems with the installation the `LLVM mailing list`_ is very
    helpful and friendly.

*CLISP* 

    (used for the optional Lisp translation backend)
	http://clisp.cons.org/_
