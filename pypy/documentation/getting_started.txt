Just the facts 
============== 

getting & running the PyPy 0.6.1 release 
-----------------------------------------

    Note that the 0.6 release was broken and 
    thus you find only the 0.6.1 release here. 

Download one of the following release files and unpack it: 

*pypy-0.6.1 (05/21/2005)*
    
  * download one of `pypy-0.6.1.tar.bz2`_, `pypy-0.6.1.tar.gz`_ or
    `pypy-0.6.1.zip`_ (windows line-endings) and unpack it 
    
  * alternatively run ``svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/release/0.6.1 pypy-0.6.1`` 

then change to the ``pypy-0.6.1`` directory
and execute the following command line:: 

    python pypy/bin/py.py 

This will give you a PyPy prompt, i.e. a very compliant 
Python interpreter implemented in Python.  Because this version
of PyPy still runs on top of CPython, it runs around 2000
times slower than the original CPython.  The release focus 
really was on compliancy: PyPy passes around `90% of CPythons core 
language regression tests`_. 

Have a look at `interesting starting points`_ 
for guidance on how to continue.

.. _`pypy-0.6.1.tar.gz`: http://codespeak.net/download/pypy/pypy-0.6.1.tar.gz

Svn-check out & run the latest PyPy as a two-liner
--------------------------------------------------

If you want to play with the ongoing development PyPy version 
you can check it out from the repository using subversion. Download 
and install subversion_ if you don't allready have it. Then you can
issue on the command line (DOS box or terminal)::

    svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist pypy-dist 

This will create a directory named ``pypy-dist``, and will get you the PyPy
source in ``pypy-dist/pypy`` and documentation files in
``pypy-dist/pypy/documentation``.

After checkout you can get a PyPy interpreter via:: 

    python pypy-dist/pypy/bin/py.py

have fun :-) 

We have some `help on installing subversion`_ for PyPy. 
Have a look at `interesting starting points`_ 
for some guidance on how to continue. 

.. _`help on installing subversion`: svn-help.html
.. _subversion: svn-help.html

Understanding PyPy's architecture
---------------------------------

For in-depth information about architecture and coding documentation 
head over to the `documentation section`_ where you'll find lots of 
interesting information.  Additionally, in true hacker spirit, you 
may just `start reading sources`_ . 

.. _`documentation section`: index.html 

running all of PyPy's tests  
---------------------------

If you want to see if PyPy works on your machine/platform 
you can simply run PyPy's large test suite with:: 

    python pypy/test_all.py 

test_all.py is just another name for `py.test`_ which is the
testing tool that we are using and enhancing for PyPy.   

Filing bugs or feature requests 
-------------------------------

You may file `bug reports`_ on our issue tracker which is
also accessible through the 'issues' top menu of 
the PyPy website.  `using the development tracker`_ has 
more detailed information on specific features of the tracker. 

.. _`using the development tracker`: coding-guide.html#using-development-tracker

.. _`interesting starting points`: 

Interesting Starting Points in PyPy 
===================================

The following assumes that you have successfully downloaded and extracted the
PyPy release or have checked out PyPy using svn. It assumes that you are in
the top level directory of the PyPy source tree, e.g. pypy-x.x (if you
got a release) or pypy-dist (if you checked out the most recent version using
subversion).

Main entry point  
------------------------------------------

The py.py interpreter
+++++++++++++++++++++

To start interpreting Python with PyPy, use Python 2.3 or greater::

    cd pypy/bin
    python py.py

After a few seconds (remember: this is running on top of CPython), 
you should be at the PyPy prompt, which is the same as the Python 
prompt, but with an extra ">".

Now you are ready to start running Python code.  Most Python
modules should work if they don't involve CPython extension 
modules.  Here is an example of determining PyPy's performance 
in pystones:: 

    >>>> from test import pystone 
    >>>> pystone.main(10)

Note that this is a slightly modified version of pystone -- the
original version does not accept the parameter to main().  The
parameter is the number of loops to run through the test, and the
default is 50000, which is far too many to run in a reasonable time
on the current PyPy implementation.

py.py options
+++++++++++++

To list the PyPy interpreter command line options, type::

    cd pypy/bin
    python py.py --help

As an example of using PyPy from the command line, you could type::

    python py.py -c "from test import pystone; pystone.main(10)"

Alternatively, as with regular Python, you can simply give a
script name on the command line::

    python py.py ../../lib-python/modified-2.3.4/test/pystone.py 10

special PyPy features 
-------------------------- 

Interpreter-level console
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are a few extra features of the PyPy console: If you press
<Ctrl-C> on the console you enter the interpreter-level console, a
usual CPython console.  You can then access internal objects of PyPy
(e.g. the object space) and any variables you have created on the PyPy
prompt with the prefix ``w_``:: 

    >>>> a = 123
    >>>> <Ctrl-C>
    *** Entering interpreter-level console ***
    >>> w_a
    W_IntObject(123)

Note that the prompt of the interpreter-level console is only '>>>' since
it runs on CPython level. If you want to return to PyPy, press <Ctrl-D> (under
Linux) or <Ctrl-Z>, <Enter> (under Windows).

You may be interested in reading more about the distinction between
`interpreter-level and app-level`_.

.. _`interpreter-level and app-level`: architecture.html#interpreter-level

.. _`trace example`: 

Tracing bytecode and operations on objects
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

You can use the trace object space to monitor the interpretation
of bytecodes in connection with object space operations.  To enable 
it, set ``__pytrace__=1`` on the interactive PyPy console:: 

    >>>> __pytrace__ = 1
    Tracing enabled
    >>>> a = 1 + 2
    |- <<<< enter <inline>a = 1 + 2 @ 1 >>>>
    |- 0    LOAD_CONST    0 (W_IntObject(1))
    |- 3    LOAD_CONST    1 (W_IntObject(2))
    |- 6    BINARY_ADD
      |-    add(W_IntObject(1), W_IntObject(2))   -> W_IntObject(3)
    |- 7    STORE_NAME    0 (a)
      |-    setitem(W_DictObject([<Entry 3098577608L,W_StringObject('__builtins__'),
                    <pypy.module..., W_StringObject('a'), W_IntObject(3))   
            -> <W_NoneObject()>
    |-10    LOAD_CONST    2 (<W_NoneObject()>)
    |-13    RETURN_VALUE
    |- <<<< leave <inline>a = 1 + 2 @ 1 >>>>


lazily computed objects 
+++++++++++++++++++++++

One of the original features provided by PyPy is the "thunk" 
object space, providing lazily-computed objects in a fully
transparent manner::

    cd pypy/bin
    python py.py -o thunk

    >>>> def longcomputation(lst):
    ....     print "computing..."
    ....     return sum(lst)
    .... 
    >>>> x = thunk(longcomputation, range(5))
    >>>> y = thunk(longcomputation, range(10))

from the application perspective, ``x`` and ``y`` represent 
exactly the objects being returned by the ``longcomputation()``
invocations.  You can put these objects into a dictionary 
without triggering the computation:: 

    >>>> d = {5: x, 10: y}
    >>>> result = d[5]
    >>>> result
    computing...
    10
    >>>> type(d[10])
    computing...
    <type 'int'>
    >>>> d[10]
    45

It is interesting to note that this lazy-computing Python extension 
is solely implemented in a small `objspace/thunk.py`_ file consisting 
of around 100 lines of code. 

Running the tests
+++++++++++++++++

The PyPy project uses test-driven-development.  Right now, there are
a couple of different categories of tests which you can run.
To run all the unit tests::

    cd pypy
    python test_all.py

Alternatively, you may run subtests by going to the correct subdirectory
and running them individually::

    python test_all.py module/test/test_builtin.py

``test_all.py`` is actually just a synonym for `py.test`_ which is 
our external testing tool. If you have installed that you 
can as well just issue ``py.test DIRECTORY_OR_FILE`` in order 
to perform test runs or simply start it without arguments to 
run all tests below the current directory. 

Finally, there are the CPython regression tests which you can 
run like this::

    cd lib-python/2.3.4/test 
    python ../../../pypy/test_all.py -E

or if you have `installed py.test`_ then you simply say::

    py.test -E

from the lib-python-2.3.4/test directory. 

.. _`installed py.test`: http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/getting-started.html

Demos
+++++

The `demo/`_ directory contains examples of various aspects of PyPy,
ranging from running regular Python programs (that we used as compliance goals) 
over experimental distribution mechanisms to examples translating 
sufficiently static programs into low level code. 

.. _`try out the translator`:

Trying out the translator
------------------------- 

The translator is a tool based on the PyPy interpreter which can translate
sufficiently static Python programs into low-level code. To be able to use it
you need to:

  * Download and install `Dot Graphviz`_.

  * Download and install Pygame_ if you do not already have it.

To start the interactive translator do::

    cd pypy/bin
    python translator.py

Test snippets of translatable code are provided in the file
``pypy/translator/test/snippet.py``, which is imported under the name
``test``.  For example::

    >>> t = Translator(test.is_perfect_number)
    >>> t.view()
        
.. >>> from pypy.translator.translator import Translator 
.. >>> from pypy.translator.test import snippet as test 


trying out the type annotator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have a type annotator that can completely infer types for functions like
``is_perfect_number`` (as well as for much larger examples)::

    >>> a = t.annotate([int])
    >>> t.view()

Move the mouse over variable names (in red) to see their inferred types. To
perform simplifications based on the annotation you can do::

    >>> a.simplify()


translating the flow graph to C code
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The graph can be turned into C code::

   >>> t.specialize()
   >>> f = t.ccompile()

The first command replaces operations with variables of types that are
avaiable in C (e.g. int) with low level versions. This can be ommited if no
annotation (see last subsection) has been performed.


translating the flow graph to LLVM code
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you feel adventureous (and have `LLVM installed`_ and on your path) you can
also try to compile the graph with LLVM. This is still quite experimental
and only works with some functions: One of the most visible restriction is
that return type of the entry function has to be and int, float or bool. To
try it do::

   >>> print t.llvm()
   >>> f = t.llvmcompile(optimize=True)
   >>> f(28)
   1

This works only with fully annotated graphs.

a slightly larger example
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

There is a small-to-medium demo showing the translator and the annotator::

    cd demo
    python bpnn.py

This causes ``bpnn.py`` to display itself as a call graph and class
hierarchy.  Clicking on functions shows the flow graph of the particular
function.  Clicking on a class shows the attributes of its instances.  All
this information (call graph, local variables' types, attributes of
instances) is computed by the annotator.

As soon as you close the PyGame window, the function is turned into C code,
compiled and executed.

translating the PyPy interpreter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Not for the faint of heart nor the owner of a very old machine: you can
run the annotator over the whole PyPy interpreter itself.  This is the
largest and ultimate example of source that our annotator can (very
successfully!) process::

    cd pypy/translator/goal
    python translate_pypy.py -no-t -no-c

Moving around is difficult because of the sheer size of the result.
For this reason, the debugger prompt you get at the end has been
enhanced with commands to facilitate locating functions and classes.
Type ``help graphs`` for a list of the new commands.  Help is also
available on each of these new commands.

The ``translate_pypy`` script itself takes a number of options controlling
what to translate and how.  See ``translate_pypy.py -h``.  Try out::

    cd pypy/translator/goal
    python translate_pypy.py targetrpystone

or a simplified, scaled-down version::

    python translate_pypy.py targetrpystone2


.. _`start reading sources`: 

Where to start reading the sources
---------------------------------- 

PyPy is made from parts that are relatively independent from each other.
You should start looking at the part that attracts you most (all parts are
relative to the PyPy toplevel directory).  You may look at our `directory reference`_ 
or start off at one of the following points:

*  `pypy/interpreter`_ contains the basic interpreter: bytecode dispatcher
   in pyopcode.py_, frame and code objects in eval.py_ and pyframe.py_,
   function objects and argument passing in function.py_ and argument.py_,
   the object space interface definition in baseobjspace.py_, modules in
   module.py_ and mixedmodule.py_.  Core types supporting the interpreter are
   defined in typedef.py_.

*  `pypy/objspace/std`_ contains the `Standard object space`_.  The main file
   is objspace.py_.  For each type, the files ``xxxtype.py`` and
   ``xxxobject.py`` contain respectively the definition of the type and its
   (default) implementation.

*  `pypy/objspace`_ contains a few other object spaces: the thunk_
   one, the trace_ one, the flow_ one.  The latter is a relatively short piece
   of  code that builds the control flow graphs when the interpreter runs in it.

*  `pypy/translator`_ contains the code analysis and generation stuff.
   Start reading from translator.py_, from which it should be easy to follow
   the pieces of code involved in the various translation phases.

*  `pypy/annotation`_ contains the data model for the type annotation that
   can be inferred about a graph.  The graph "walker" that uses this is in
   `pypy/translator/annrpython.py`_.


.. _optionaltool: 

Additional Tools for running (and hacking) PyPy 
-----------------------------------------------

We use some optional tools for developing PyPy. They are not required to run 
the basic tests or to get an interactive PyPy prompt but they help to
understand  and debug PyPy especially for the ongoing translation work.  

graphviz & pygame for flowgraph viewing (highly recommended)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

graphviz and pygame are both neccessary if you
want to look at generated flowgraphs: 

	graphviz: http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html 

	pygame: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

.. _`LLVM installed`: 

LLVM  
+++++ 

LLVM is used by the optional `PyPy/LLVM backend`_ to generate
processor indepdendant machine level code for the `low level
virtual machine`_.  LLVM can be quite annoying to install: you
need a fairly recent version of GCC to compile it and there
can be severe problems under windows.  **NOTE: To use the LLVM
backend of PyPy you don't need the GCC front end of LLVM, only
LLVM itself**.  Here are detailed instructions on how to
install: 

    http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/docs/GettingStarted.html

If you run into problems with the installation the `LLVM
mailing list`_ is very helpful and friendly.  Note also that
the PyPy LLVM backend was developed using LLVM 1.4 but it
seems to work with LLVM 1.5. Nobody ever tried an older
version.

CLISP
+++++++

The CLISP backend is optional and not quite uptodate with the rest of
PyPy. Still there are a few examples you can try our backend out on. 
Here is a link to a LISP implementation that should basically work: 

    http://clisp.cons.org/ 


.. _`py.test`:  

py.test and the py lib 
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The `py library`_ is used for supporting PyPy development and 
running our tests against code and documentation as well as
compliancy tests.  You don't need to install the py library because 
it ships with PyPy and `pypy/test_all.py`_ is an alias for ``py.test``
but if you want to have the ``py.test`` tool generally in your 
path, you might like to visit: 

    http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/getting-started.html



Getting involved 
================================== 

PyPy employs an open development process.  You are invited 
to join our `pypy-dev mailing list`_ or look at the other 
`contact possibilities`_.   We are also doing coding Sprints
which are separatedly announced and often happen around Python
conferences such as EuroPython or Pycon.
