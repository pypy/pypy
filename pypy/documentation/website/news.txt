    The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
    implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
    description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
    Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
    nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

Next Sprint after EuroPython 2005 1st-7th July 
======================================================

The next sprint is scheduled right after EuroPython_ 2005 in
Göteborg, Sweden.  We take a day of break after the conference
and start sprinting from 1st-7th of July 2005.  See the
`sprint announcement`_ and the `list of people coming`_.  The
sprint theme is related strongly to `translation`_ and working
towards getting a first self-contained PyPy version.
Additionally there will be a four day Pre-EuroPython sprint
for people who already are familiar with the PyPy code base.

First PyPy release!
=================== 

We are happy to announce the first public release of PyPy after two years of
spare-time and half a year of EU funded development.  The 0.6 release is
a preview release, concentrating on CPython compatibility, good documentation 
and nice starting points into the PyPy code base.  We invite you to head 
over to the `getting started`_ document or read more in the 
`release announcement`_.  *(05/20/2005)*
