example of interp-level code needing to somehow call an external function::

    import os
    def open(space, w_fname):
        fname = space.str_w(fname)
        fd = os.open(fname)
        return space.wrap(fd)

* os.open will be special-cased along all translation levels, there
  will be a table mapping "sys calls" functions to the information
  needed by the various levels.
 
* annotation/builtin.py will take information from the common table 
  to annotate the calls.

* rtyper will replace the calls with for testing or dummy lowlevel
  functions (ll_os_open for os.open), specified somehow trough the
  table (issue: how to annotate these helper calls avoiding making
  copies as in the usual case, so that the backends can recognize them)

* the backends will have implementations for these helper functions
  (to allow writing such implementations we will need a way to assign
  fixed names for some of the defined lltypes introduced by the rtyper)
