Coding Style
=====================================


Naming and environment
-----------------------------

- directories/modules/namespaces are always **lowercase**

- classes are **CamelCase**

- never use plural names in directory and file names

- ``__init__.py`` is always empty except for ``"pypy/objspace/*"``

- functions/methods are lowercase and ``'_'-separated`` (if
  you need to separate at all)

- not more than 4 directory nesting levels

- it's appreciated if you manage to name files in a directory
  so that tab-completion on the shell level is as easy as possible. 

Committing
----------

- it's nice to write good log messages because several people
  are reading the diffs. 

- if you add (text/py) files to the repository then please run
  pypy/tool/fixeol in that directory.  This will make sure 
  that the property 'svn:eol-style' is set to native which 
  allows checkin/checkout in native line-ending format.

Object Spaces
---------------

- objectspace classes are always spelled "ObjSpace". e.g.

  - TrivialObjSpace
  - StdObjSpace
  - FlowObjSpace

- at interpreter level and in ObjSpace all boxed values
  have a leading ``w_`` to indicate "wrapped values".  This
  includes w_self.  Don't use ``w_`` in application level
  python only code.

Test conventions
----------------

- adding features usually requires adding appropriate tests. 
  (It often even makes sense to first write the tests so that you are
  sure that they actually can fail.) 

- All over the pypy source code there are test/ directories 
  which contain unittests.  Such scripts can usually be executed
  directly or are collectively run by pypy/test_all.py 

- each test directory needs a copy of pypy/tool/autopath.py which
  upon import will make sure that sys.path contains the directory
  where 'pypy' is in. 

- see some more information about tests at the test-design_ document.
