Mission statement 
====================

PyPy is a reimplementation of Python_ written in Python itself, flexible and
easy to experiment with.  Our long-term goals are to target a large variety of
platforms, small and large, by providing a compiler toolsuite that can produce
custom Python versions.  Platform, Memory and Threading models are to become
aspects of the translation process - as opposed to encoding low level details
into a language implementation itself.  Eventually, dynamic optimization techniques
- implemented as another translation aspect - should become robust against
language changes.


PyPy - an implementation of Python in Python
============================================

It has become a tradition in the development of computer languages to
implement each language in itself. This serves many purposes. By doing so,
you demonstrate the versatility of the language, and its applicability for
large projects.  Writing compilers and interpreters are among the most 
complex endeavours in software development. 

An important aspect of implementing Python in Python is the high level of
abstraction and compactness of the language. This allows an implementation
that is, in some respects, easier to understand and play with than the one
done in C.  Actually, the existing CPython implementation is mostly 
well written and it is often possible to manually translate according
CPython code to PyPy by just stripping away many low level details. 

Another carrying idea in PyPy is to build the implementation in the form
of a number of independent modules with clearly defined and well tested API's. 
This eases reuse and allows experimenting with multiple implementations 
of specific features.

Later in the project, we will introduce optimizations, following the ideas
of Psyco_ and Stackless_, that should make PyPy run Python programs 
faster than CPython.

Status of the implementation (May 2005)
---------------------------------------

In a number of one week sprints, attracting approximately 10 developers each,
we made an almost complete implementation of Python in Python. Currently it is
slow, benchmarking at a factor 2000 times slower than regular Python
(henceforth referred to as CPython). This was expected because running a
bytecode interpreter on top of CPython obviously imposes a
double-interpretation penalty. 

Our rather complete and Python 2.3-compliant interpreter is about 22000 lines 
of code, with another 7000 lines of unit tests.  If we include the tools, the
parts related to code analysis and generation, and the standard library
modules ported from C, PyPy is now 55000 lines of code and 20000 lines of
tests.

PyPy already passes a lot of CPython's own regression tests, including 90% of the 
core tests not depending on C extension modules (most of the remaining 10% are
arguably dependant on very obscure implementation details of CPython).

For some time now the bleeding edge PyPy work has been focused on generating
reasonably efficient C code from the source of PyPy, thereby reducing the
speed penalty.  This goal is no longer far away.


Higher level picture
====================

The various parts of PyPy have always been under more or less heavy
refactoring since its inception. However, the higher level architecture
remains rather simple and unchanged.  There are two independent basic
subsystems:

The Standard Interpreter
------------------------

The *standard interpreter* is the subsystem implementing the Python language.
It is divided in two components:

- the `plain interpreter`_ which is responsible for interpreting 
  code objects and implementing bytecodes,

- the `standard object space`_ which implements creation, access and
  modification of application level objects,

Note that the *standard interpreter* can run fine on top of CPython 
(the C Implementation of Python led by Guido van Rossum), if one is
willing to pay for the double-interpretation performance penalty.

Please note that we are using the term *interpreter* most often in
reference to the *plain interpreter* which just knows enough to read,
dispatch and implement *bytecodes* thus shuffling objects around on the
stack and between namespaces.  The (plain) interpreter is completely
ignorant of how to access, modify or construct objects and their
structure and thus delegates such operations to a so called `Object Space`_.

In addition, the standard interpreter requires a parser and bytecode compiler
to turn the user's Python source code into a form amenable to
interpretation.  This is currently still borrowed from CPython, but we
have two experimental parser modules in the source tree which are in the
process of being integrated.

The Translation Process
-----------------------

The *translation process* aims at producing a different (low-level)
representation of our standard interpreter.  The *translation process* 
is done in four steps:

- producing a *flow graph* representation of the standard interpreter. 
  A combination of a `plain interpreter`_ and a *flow object space*
  performs *abstract interpretation* to record the flow of objects
  and execution throughout a python program into such a *flow graph*.

- the *annotator* which performs type inference on the flow graph 

- the *typer* which, based on the type annotations, turns the flow graph
  into one using only low-level, C-like operations

- the *code generator* which translates the resulting flow graph into
  another language, currently C or LLVM.

See below for the `translation process in more details`_.


.. _`plain interpreter`:

The Bytecode Interpreter
=========================

The *plain bytecode interpreter* handles python code objects. The interpreter can 
build code objects from Python sources, when needed, by invoking Python's
builtin compiler (we also have a way of constructing those code objects
from python source only, but we have not integrated it yet).  Code objects
are a nicely preprocessed, structured representation of source code, and
their main content is *bytecode*.  In addition, code objects also know
how to create a *frame* object which has the responsibility to
*interpret* a code object's bytecode.  Each bytecode is implemented by a
python function, which, in turn, delegates operations on
application-level objects to an object space. 

This part is implemented in the `interpreter/`_ directory.  People familiar
with the CPython implementation of the above concepts will easily recognize
them there.  The major differences are the overall usage of the `Object Space`_
indirection to perform operations on objects, and the organization of the
built-in modules (described `here`_).

.. _`here`: coding-guide.html#modules


.. _`objectspace`: 
.. _`Object Space`: 

The Object Space
================

The object space creates all objects and knows how to perform operations
on the objects. You may think of an object space as being a library
offering a fixed API, a set of *operations*, with implementations that
correspond to the known semantics of Python objects.  An example of an
operation is *add*: add's implementations are, for example, responsible
for performing numeric addition when add works on numbers, concatenation
when add works on built-in sequences.

All object-space operations take and return `application-level`_ objects.
There are only a few, very simple, object-space operation which allows the
interpreter to gain some knowledge about the value of an
application-level object.
The most important one is ``is_true()``, which returns a boolean
interpreter-level value.  This is necessary to implement, for example,
if-statements (or rather, to be pedantic, to implement the
conditional-branching bytecodes into which if-statements get compiled). 

We currently have four working object spaces which can be plugged into
the interpreter:

.. _`standard object space`:

- The *Standard Object Space* is a complete implementation 
  of the various built-in types and objects of Python.  The Standard Object
  Space, together with the interpreter, is the foundation of our Python
  implementation.  Internally, it is a set of `interpreter-level`_ classes
  implementing the various `application-level`_ objects -- integers, strings,
  lists, types, etc.  To draw a comparison with CPython, the Standard Object
  Space provides the equivalent of the C structures ``PyIntObject``,
  ``PyListObject``, etc.

- the *Trace Object Space* wraps e.g. the standard 
  object space in order to trace the execution of bytecodes, 
  frames and object space operations.

- the *Thunk Object Space* wraps another object space (e.g. the standard
  one) and adds two capabilities: lazily computed objects (computed only when
  an operation is performed on them), and "become", which completely and
  globally replaces an object with another.

- the *Flow Object Space* transforms a Python program into a
  flow-graph representation, by recording all operations that the interpreter
  would like to perform when it is shown the given Python program.  This
  technique is explained `later in this document`_.

For a description of the object spaces, please see the
`objspace document`_.  The sources of PyPy contain the various object spaces
in the directory `objspace/`_.

.. _`application-level`:
.. _`interpreter-level`:

Application-level and interpreter-level execution and objects
=============================================================

Since Python is used for implementing all of our code base, there is a
crucial distinction to be aware of: *interpreter-level* objects versus
*application-level* objects.  The latter are the ones that you deal with
when you write normal python programs.  Interpreter-level code, however,
cannot invoke operations nor access attributes from application-level
objects.  You will immediately recognize any interpreter level code in
PyPy, because half the variable and object names start with a ``w_``, which
indicates that they are `wrapped`_ application-level values. 

Let's show the difference with a simple example.  To sum the contents of
two variables ``a`` and ``b``, typical application-level code is ``a+b``
-- in sharp contrast, typical interpreter-level code is ``space.add(w_a,
w_b)``, where ``space`` is an instance of an object space, and ``w_a``
and ``w_b`` are typical names for the wrapped versions of the two
variables.  

It helps to remember how CPython deals with the same issue: interpreter
level code, in CPython, is written in C, and thus typical code for the
addition is ``PyNumber_Add(p_a, p_b)`` where ``p_a`` and ``p_b`` are C
variables of type ``PyObject*``. This is very similar to how we write
our interpreter-level code in Python.

Moreover, in PyPy we have to make a sharp distinction between
interpreter- and application-level *exceptions*: application exceptions
are always contained inside an instance of ``OperationError``.  This
makes it easy to distinguish failures (or bugs) in our interpreter-level code
from failures appearing in a python application level program that we are
interpreting.


.. _`app-preferable`: 

Application level is often preferable 
-------------------------------------

Application-level code is substantially higher-level, and therefore
correspondingly easier to write and debug.  For example, suppose we want
to implement the ``update`` method of dict objects.  Programming at
application level, we can write an obvious, simple implementation, one
that looks like an **executable definition** of ``update``, for
example::

    def update(self, other):
        for k in other.keys():
            self[k] = other[k]

If we had to code only at interpreter level, we would have to code
something much lower-level and involved, say something like::

    def update(space, w_self, w_other):
        w_keys = space.call_method(w_other, 'keys')
        w_iter = space.iter(w_keys)
        while True:
            try:
                w_key = space.next(w_iter)
            except OperationError, e:
                if not e.match(space, space.w_StopIteration):
                    raise       # re-raise other app-level exceptions
                break
            w_value = space.getitem(w_other, w_key)
            space.setitem(w_self, w_key, w_value)

This interpreter-level implementation looks much more similar to the C
source code.  It is still more readable than it's C counterpart because 
it doesn't contain memory management details and can use Python's native 
exception mechanism. 

In any case, it should be obvious that the application-level implementation 
is definitely more readable, more elegant and more maintainable than the
interpreter-level one.

In fact, in almost all parts of PyPy, you find application level code in
the middle of interpreter-level code.  Apart from some bootstrapping
problems (application level functions need a certain initialization
level of the object space before they can be executed), application
level code is usually preferable.  We have an abstraction (called
'Gateway') which allows the caller of a function to remain ignorant of
whether a particular function is implemented at application or
interpreter level. 


.. _`wrapped`:

Wrapping
--------- 

The ``w_`` prefixes so lavishly used in the previous example indicate,
by PyPy coding convention, that we are dealing with *wrapped* objects,
that is, interpreter-level objects which the object space constructs
to implement corresponding application-level objects.  Each object
space supplies ``wrap`` and ``unwrap``, ``int_w``, ``interpclass_w``,
etc. operations that move between the two levels for objects of simple
built-in types; each object space also implements other Python types
with suitable interpreter-level classes with some amount of internal
structure.

For example, an application-level Python ``list``
is implemented by the `standard object space`_ as an
instance of ``W_ListObject``, which has an instance attribute
``ob_item`` (an interpreter-level list which contains the
application-level list's items as wrapped objects) and another attribute
``ob_size`` which records the application-level list's length (we want
to be able to do "over-allocation" in ``ob_item``, for the same reasons
of performance that lead CPython to do it, and therefore the length of
``ob_item`` is allowed to be greater than the length of the
application-level list -- it is for this reason that the length in
question has to be explicitly recorded in ``ob_size``).

The rules are described in more details `in the coding guide`_.

RPython, the Flow Object Space and translation
==============================================

One of PyPy's now-short-term objectives is to enable translation of our
interpreter and standard object space into a lower-level language.  In
order for our translation and type inference mechanisms to work
effectively, we need to restrict the dynamism of our interpreter-level
Python code at some point.  However, in the start-up phase, we are
completely free to use all kind of nice python constructs, including
metaclasses and execution of dynamically constructed strings.  However,
when the initialization phase (mainly, the function
``objspace.initialize()``) finishes, all code objects involved need to
adhere to a more static subset of Python:
Restricted Python, also known as `RPython`_. 

The Flow Object Space then, with the help of our plain interpreter,
works through those initialized RPython code objects.  The result of
this `abstract interpretation`_ is a flow graph: yet another
representation of a python program, but one which is suitable for
applying translation and type inference techniques.  The nodes of the
graph are basic blocks consisting of Object Space operations, flowing
of values, and an exitswitch to one, two or multiple links which connect
each basic block to other basic blocks. 

The flow graphs are fed as input into the Annotator.  The Annotator,
given entry point types, infers the types of values that flow through
the program variables.  Here, the definition of `RPython`_ comes
again into play: RPython code is restricted in such a way that the
Annotator is able to infer consistent types.  In total, how much
dynamism we allow in RPython depends, and is restricted by, the Flow
Object Space and the Annotator implementation.  The more we can improve
this translation phase, the more dynamism we can allow.  In some cases,
however, it will probably be more feasible and practical to just get rid
of some of the dynamism we use in our interpreter level code.  It is
mainly because of this trade-off situation that the definition of
RPython has been shifting quite a bit.  Although the Annotator is
pretty stable now, and able to process the whole of PyPy, the RPython
definition will probably continue to shift marginally as we improve it.

The actual low-level code (and, in fact, also other high-level code) is
emitted by "visiting" the type-annotated flow graph.  Currently we have
a C-producing backend, and an LLVM-producing backend.  The former also
accepts non-annotated or partially-annotated graphs, which allow us to
test it on a larger class of programs than what the Annotator can (or
ever will) fully process.

A new piece of this puzzle, still being integrated (May 2005), is the
*Typer*, which inputs the high-level types inferred by the Annotator and
uses them to modify the flow graph in-place to replace its operations with
low-level ones, directly manipulating C-like values and data structures.

The complete translation process is described in more details in the
`translation document`_.
