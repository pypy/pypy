General
=======

* not all of CPython's exceptions use the same __init__!

StdObjSpace
===========

* find a way via hacking or elegance to run CPython's unit tests
  against the StdObjSpace.

* String formatting still needs work (field widths, precision, ...)

* Provide an importer that can import packages. (we have a 
  limited __import__ builtin defined)  <---- done now?

  Consider PEP 302, new import hooks.
  Try to write as much as possible in app-level.
  How would PyPy import CPython extensions?

* (documentation) generate a nice dot-graph from the structure of PyPy

* port pypy's testing framework to std.utest (probably a sprint topic, 
  as some discussion how to do it is required) 

* (documentation) remove/retire all web-pages referencing e.g.
  AnnSpace or other deprecated stuff

* Review, enhance the new mixed-level module mechanism
  (e.g. the module/builtin*.py files comprise the builtin module)
  and try to apply the same technique for the application level 
  type definitions (types.py). Think about a way to split up
  especially app-level definitions of __builtin__ into multiple
  files. (like allowing __builtin__ to be a directory with files
  comprising the complete definition of the builtin module etc.pp) 

* review whatever you like 

* clear out and do a clean implementation of multimethod delegation.
  The idea is to give 'kinds' to arguments according to their use,
  e.g. 'numeric argument' or 'object whose identity is preserved'.
  A 'kind' encapsulates a set of delegation functions. Armin has
  already written documentation for the envisioned new multimethod 
  implementation:

  http://codespeak.net/pypy/index.cgi?doc/objspace/multimethod

  (now irrelevant?  not sure... (nowadays, we have the descriptor 
  mechanism implemented right before EuroPython 2004 for both the 
  trivial and the stdobjspace))

Translator
==========

* enhance the translator components to accept more of PyPy ...

Tools
=====

* add web server thread (!) that allows inspection of e.g. app-level
  tracebacks (and stop clogging the user's terminal with them).
  --> there is some preliminary working code in tool/tb_server 

* improve traceobjectspace! currently it only catches 
  calls from outside the space into the space but not
  the ones where space operations involve calling more space 
  operations (the latter are not traced)!
