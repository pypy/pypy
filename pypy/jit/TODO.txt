- review codegen (e.g. getfield/setfield for size != word)

- [] (getitem) used inside complex try/except ends up using the bound
  checking version: transformation after flowgraphing that marks op
  with implicit exceptions only if they are inside a precise
  try:except:

- stability + do something about bytecode_trace such that the jit
  branch can be merged

- global merge point and portal should delegate their cache impl.
  to the application (to allow keeping things alive correctly)

- unify the notion of the portal entry cache with an implicit global
  merge point (for the purpose of promotion), conceptually at the
  beginning of the portal, but concretely implemented in the portal
  entry



Improvements
-------------

- make frames virtual

- promotions for "python dispatching"

- do something correct about bytecode_trace

- floats

- improve backends (reg. allocation ...)

- jit-friendlier interpreter (whatever, as needed)

- reduce the size of the timeshifted code: no dispatch for no
  split/merge functions ...
