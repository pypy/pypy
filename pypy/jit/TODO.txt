- fix the XXXs in codegen

- IN-PROGRESS: [] (getitem) used inside complex try/except ends up using the bound
  checking version: transformation after flowgraphing that marks op
  with implicit exceptions only if they are inside a precise
  try:except:

- global merge point and portal should delegate their cache impl.
  to the application (to allow keeping things alive correctly)

- unify the notion of the portal entry cache with an implicit global
  merge point (for the purpose of promotion), conceptually at the
  beginning of the portal, but concretely implemented in the portal
  entry

- make backend opts usable on the interp+timeshifted interp graph forest

Open issues
--------------

- think about aliasing issues with virtualizables

Improvements
-------------

- make frames virtual

- promotions for "python dispatching"

- do something correct about bytecode_trace

- floats

- improve backends (reg. allocation, produce code more lazily in larger units and avoid for example
   many open machine blocks at the same time without resorting to many jumps...)

- jit-friendlier interpreter (whatever, as needed)

- reduce the size of the timeshifted code: no dispatch for no
  split/merge functions ...

- insert hints to forget uninteresting constants, e.g. the
  initial 0 of RPython list iterators

- pyopcode.compare_dispatch_table => switch statement

- share code between the machine code backends (MachineCodeBlock,
  possibly register allocation)
