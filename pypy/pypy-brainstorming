General ideas of what PyPy should achieve for us

- Python interpreter written in python
    - loads bytecode
    - delegates/dispatches to ObjectSpaces to implement operations
      on the objects
    - there can be more than one ObjectSpace
        - for example: BorrowingObjectSpace (from CPython)
    - define/implement a class that emulates the Python 
      Execution Frame

- use the main-loop of the interpreter to do a lot of
  things (e.g. do type inference during running the bytecode 
  or not even run the bytecodes, but interpret various attributes of the code) 

- working together, producing something real

- saving interpreter state to an image (following the smalltalk model)
  process-migration / persistence

- looking at the entire code base (living in an image), browsing 
  objects interactively 

- interactive environment, trying code snippets, introspection

- deploying python made easy, integrate version control systems

- integrate the various technologies on the web site, issue tracking,
  Wiki...

- seperate exception handling from the mainline code, avoid peppering
  your code with try :-), put exception handling into objects.

- import python code from the version control store directly, give
  imported code also a time dimension 

- combining python interpreters from multiple machines (cluster) into a
  virtual sandbox (agent space?) 

- get a smaller (maybe faster) python with very few C-code

- (hoping for Psyc) to render fast code from Python code (instead of
  hard-c)

- go to a higher level python core (and write out/generate interpreters
  in different languages), e.g. the former P-to-C resolved the evalframe-loop
  but still called into the Python-C-library which is statically coded

- very far fetched: PyPython becomes a/the reference implementation
 
- have enough flexibility to make a separate stackless obsolete

- have a language that is high-level/easy enough to program
  but with the same performance as statically compiled languages
  (e.g. C++)


what is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter
------------------------------------------------------------

f = bytecode interpreter
p = program
a = arguments

c = compiler

assert f(p, a) == c(p)(a) == r


-  architecture overview
    * byte code interp loop
      plan how the interp loop should look like from a hi level
      map that structure in descriptions that can be used to generate interpreters/compilers
      define the frame structure

    * define a object/type model that maps into python data structures
      wrap cpython objects into the new object model so we can continue
      to use cpython modules
    
    * rewrite c python modules and the builtin object library in python
      optimzation for a potential global python optimizer, until that
      exists it will be slower than the corresponding cpython implementation

- import the cpython distribution so we can use parts of it in our
  repository, make it easy to follow the cpython development

- finish the python to byte code compiler in python project (this is
  already part of the cpython distribution, needs a python lexer)

- doing other things than interpreting byte code from the python interp
  loop, for example generate C code, implement other object spaces in our
  terminlogy other far fetched things with execution

- how to enter c ysystem calls into the python object space (ctypes)
