Do now
------

- lambda called with wrong number of args issue
- RPythonize (during EP sprint)

Do next
-------

- definitions: let*

- symbols vs identifier, which name is better
  - global dict for symbols _obarray_

- implement key funcions
  (apply, reduce, mapcar and so on)
  # reduce will not make into python 3.0 ;)

- comparison: < > eq? eqv?

- rational, complex number types
  - exact/inexact

Do in some future
-----------------

Here starts the real fun!

- macros
- delayed evaluation
- continuations
- proper tail-recursion
  - mutulally recursive procedures (r5rs p.12)
- switch to bytecode generation + eval instead of evaluating AST
