Do now
------

- continuations

continuation frame must be saved fot every non tail-call
(for tail calls there is no cc)

Do next
-------

- implement key functions
  (apply, map and so on)

- comparison: < > eq? eqv?

Do in some future
-----------------

Here starts the real fun!

- lambda called with wrong number of arguments issue
- macros *are* not first-class objects

- switch to byte-code generation + eval instead of evaluating AST
