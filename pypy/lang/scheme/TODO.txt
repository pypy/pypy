Do now
------

- lambda called with wrong number of arguments issue

Do next
-------

- implement key functions
  (apply, reduce, map and so on)

- comparison: < > eq? eqv?

Do in some future
-----------------

Here starts the real fun!

- macros
  * macros are not first-class objects
- continuations
- move syntax checking to parsing
- switch to byte-code generation + eval instead of evaluating AST
