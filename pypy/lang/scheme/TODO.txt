Do now
------

- evaluate simple expressions like
  (* 6 7) or even (+ 1 2 3 4)
  - convert nodes from AST tree into W_xxx - tree.dispatch()
  - evaluate the tree
    W_xxx object like W_Fixnum should eval to itself despite context
  - implement basic operations like * / and so on

Do next
-------

- symbols, variables and execution context
  global dict for symbols _obarray_
- control structures
- functions

Do in some future
-----------------

Here starts the real fun!

- delayed evaluation
- macros
- proper tail-recursion
- continuations
