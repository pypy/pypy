**annotator**
    Performs a form of `type inference`_ on the flow graph.

.. _`application level`:

**application level**
    applevel_ code is normal Python code running on top of the PyPy or
    CPython interpreter (see `interpreter level`_)

.. _backend:

**backend** 
    Code generator that converts a `RPython
    <coding-guide.html#restricted-python>`__ program to a `target
    language`_ using the PyPy toolchain_. A backend uses either the
    lltypesystem_ or the ootypesystem_.

.. _`external function`:

**external function**
    Functions that we don't want to implement in Python for various
    reasons (e.g. if they need to make calls into the OS) and will be
    implemented by the backend.

.. _`garbage collection framework`:

**garbage collection framework**
    Code that makes it possible to write `PyPy's garbage collectors`_
    in Python itself.

.. _`interpreter level`:

**interpreter level**
   Code running at this level is part of the implementation of the
   PyPy interpreter and cannot interact normally with application
   level code; it typically provides implementation for an object
   space and its builtins. (See application level)

.. _`jit`:

**jit**
  `just in time compiler`_
   
.. _`l3interpreter`:

**l3interpreter**
   Piece of code that is able to interpret L3 flow graphs.  This code
   is unfinished and its future is unclear.

.. _`llinterpreter`:

**llinterpreter**
   Piece of code that is able to interpret flow graphs.  This is very
   useful for testing purposes, especially if you work on the RPython_
   Typer.

.. _lltypesystem:

**lltypesystem**
   A backend_ that uses this typessystem is also called a low-level
   backend.  The C and LLVM backends are using this typesystem.

.. _`mixed module`:

**mixed module**
  a module that accesses PyPy's `interpreter level`_
   
.. _`object space`:

**object space**
   The `object space <objspace.html>`__ creates all objects and knows
   how to perform operations on the objects. You may think of an
   object space as being a library offering a fixed API, a set of
   operations, with implementations that a) correspond to the known
   semantics of Python objects, b) extend or twist these semantics, or
   c) serve whole-program analysis purposes.

.. _ootypesystem:

**ootypesystem**
   A backend_ that uses this typessystem is also called a high-level
   backend.  The common lisp, javascript and cli backends are all
   using this typesystem.

.. _`prebuilt constant`:

**prebuilt constant**
   In RPython_ module globals are considered constants.  Moreover,
   global (i.e. prebuilt) lists and dictionaries are supposed to be
   immutable.  (prebuilts are sometimes called pbc's)

.. _`rpython`:

**rpython**
   `Restricted Python`_, which is the limited subset of the Python_
   specification. It is also the language that the PyPy interpreter
   itself is written in.

.. _`rtyper`:

**rtyper**
   Based on the type annotations, the `RPython Typer`_ turns the flow
   graph into one that fits the model of the target platform/backend_
   using either the lltypesystem_ or the ootypesystem_.

.. _`specialization`:

**specialization**
    XXX

.. _`stackless`:

**stackless**
    Technology that enables various forms of coroutining.

.. _`standard interpreter`:

**standard interpreter**
   It is the `subsystem implementing the Python language`_, composed
   of the bytecode interpreter and of the standard objectspace.

.. _toolchain:

**toolchain**
   The `annotator pass`_, `The RPython Typer`_, and various
   `backends`_.

.. _`transformation`:

**transformation**
   Code that modifies flowgraphs to weave in `translation-aspects`_

.. _`translator`:

**translator**
  Tool_ based on the PyPy interpreter which can translate
   sufficiently static Python programs into low-level code.

.. _`type inference`:

**type inference**
   Deduces either partially or fully the type of expressions as
   described in this `type inference article`_.
