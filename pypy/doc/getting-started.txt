What is PyPy ?
==============

PyPy is an implementation of the Python_ programming language written in
Python itself, flexible and easy to experiment with.  Our long-term goals are
to target a large variety of platforms, small and large, by providing a
compiler toolsuite that can produce custom Python versions.  Platform, memory
and threading models are to become aspects of the translation process - as
opposed to encoding low level details into the language implementation itself.
Eventually, dynamic optimization techniques - implemented as another
translation aspect - should become robust against language changes. `more...`_

Just the facts 
============== 

.. _gettingpypy: 

Downloading & running the PyPy 0.8 release 
-------------------------------------------

Download one of the following release files and unpack it: 

*pypy-0.8*
    
  * download one of 

    * `pypy-0.8.0.tar.bz2`_ (unix line endings) or
    * `pypy-0.8.0.tar.gz`_ (unix line endings) or
    * `pypy-0.8.0.zip`_ (windows line-endings) and unpack it 
    
  * alternatively run 
  
    * ``svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/release/0.8.x pypy-0.8.x``
      (the 0.8 maintenance branch)

to get it from the subversion repository then change to the
``pypy-0.8.0`` or ``pypy-0.8.x`` directory and execute the following
command line::

    python pypy/bin/py.py 

This will give you a PyPy prompt, i.e. a very compliant 
Python interpreter implemented in Python.  PyPy passes 
around `90% of CPythons core language regression tests`_. 
Because this invocation of PyPy still runs on top of 
CPython, it runs around 2000 times slower than the 
original CPython.  

However, since the 0.7.0 release it is possible to use PyPy to `translate
itself to lower level languages`_ after which it runs standalone, is not
dependant on CPython anymore and becomes faster.

Svn-check out & run the latest PyPy as a two-liner
--------------------------------------------------

If you want to play with the ongoing development PyPy version 
you can check it out from the repository using subversion. Download 
and install subversion_ if you don't allready have it. Then you can
issue on the command line (DOS box or terminal)::

    svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist pypy-dist 

This will create a directory named ``pypy-dist``, and will get you the PyPy
source in ``pypy-dist/pypy`` and documentation files in
``pypy-dist/pypy/doc``.

After checkout you can get a PyPy interpreter via:: 

    python pypy-dist/pypy/bin/py.py

have fun :-) 

We have some `help on installing subversion`_ for PyPy. 
Have a look at `interesting starting points`_ 
for some guidance on how to continue. 

.. _`help on installing subversion`: svn-help.html
.. _subversion: svn-help.html

Understanding PyPy's architecture
---------------------------------

For in-depth information about architecture and coding documentation 
head over to the `documentation section`_ where you'll find lots of 
interesting information.  Additionally, in true hacker spirit, you 
may just `start reading sources`_ . 

.. _`documentation section`: index.html 

Running all of PyPy's tests  
---------------------------

If you want to see if PyPy works on your machine/platform 
you can simply run PyPy's large test suite with:: 

    cd pypy
    python test_all.py 

test_all.py is just another name for `py.test`_ which is the
testing tool that we are using and enhancing for PyPy.   

Filing bugs or feature requests 
-------------------------------

You may file `bug reports`_ on our issue tracker which is
also accessible through the 'issues' top menu of 
the PyPy website.  `using the development tracker`_ has 
more detailed information on specific features of the tracker. 

.. _`using the development tracker`: coding-guide.html#using-development-tracker

.. _`interesting starting points`: 

Interesting Starting Points in PyPy 
===================================

The following assumes that you have successfully downloaded and extracted the
PyPy release or have checked out PyPy using svn. It assumes that you are in
the top level directory of the PyPy source tree, e.g. pypy-x.x (if you
got a release) or pypy-dist (if you checked out the most recent version using
subversion).

Main entry point  
------------------------------------------

The py.py interpreter
+++++++++++++++++++++

To start interpreting Python with PyPy, use Python 2.3 or greater::

    cd pypy/bin
    python py.py

After a few seconds (remember: this is running on top of CPython), 
you should be at the PyPy prompt, which is the same as the Python 
prompt, but with an extra ">".

Now you are ready to start running Python code.  Most Python
modules should work if they don't involve CPython extension 
modules.  Here is an example of determining PyPy's performance 
in pystones:: 

    >>>> from test import pystone 
    >>>> pystone.main(10)

The parameter is the number of loops to run through the test. The
default is 50000, which is far too many to run in a reasonable time
on the current PyPy implementation.

py.py options
+++++++++++++

To list the PyPy interpreter command line options, type::

    cd pypy/bin
    python py.py --help

As an example of using PyPy from the command line, you could type::

    python py.py -c "from test import pystone; pystone.main(10)"

Alternatively, as with regular Python, you can simply give a
script name on the command line::

    python py.py ../../lib-python/2.4.1/test/pystone.py 10

Special PyPy features 
-------------------------- 

Interpreter-level console
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are a few extra features of the PyPy console: If you press
<Ctrl-C> on the console you enter the interpreter-level console, a
usual CPython console.  You can then access internal objects of PyPy
(e.g. the object space) and any variables you have created on the PyPy
prompt with the prefix ``w_``:: 

    >>>> a = 123
    >>>> <Ctrl-C>
    *** Entering interpreter-level console ***
    >>> w_a
    W_IntObject(123)

Note that the prompt of the interpreter-level console is only '>>>' since
it runs on CPython level. If you want to return to PyPy, press <Ctrl-D> (under
Linux) or <Ctrl-Z>, <Enter> (under Windows).

You may be interested in reading more about the distinction between
`interpreter-level and app-level`_.

.. _`interpreter-level and app-level`: coding-guide.html#interpreter-level

.. _`trace example`: 

Tracing bytecode and operations on objects
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

You can use the trace object space to monitor the interpretation
of bytecodes in connection with object space operations.  To enable 
it, set ``__pytrace__=1`` on the interactive PyPy console:: 

    >>>> __pytrace__ = 1
    Tracing enabled
    >>>> a = 1 + 2
    |- <<<< enter <inline>a = 1 + 2 @ 1 >>>>
    |- 0    LOAD_CONST    0 (W_IntObject(1))
    |- 3    LOAD_CONST    1 (W_IntObject(2))
    |- 6    BINARY_ADD
      |-    add(W_IntObject(1), W_IntObject(2))   -> W_IntObject(3)
    |- 7    STORE_NAME    0 (a)
      |-    setitem(W_DictObject([<Entry 3098577608L,W_StringObject('__builtins__'),
                    <pypy.module..., W_StringObject('a'), W_IntObject(3))   
            -> <W_NoneObject()>
    |-10    LOAD_CONST    2 (<W_NoneObject()>)
    |-13    RETURN_VALUE
    |- <<<< leave <inline>a = 1 + 2 @ 1 >>>>


.. _ `lazily computed objects`:

Lazily computed objects 
+++++++++++++++++++++++

One of the original features provided by PyPy is the "thunk" 
object space, providing lazily-computed objects in a fully
transparent manner::

    cd pypy/bin
    python py.py -o thunk

    >>>> def longcomputation(lst):
    ....     print "computing..."
    ....     return sum(lst)
    .... 
    >>>> x = thunk(longcomputation, range(5))
    >>>> y = thunk(longcomputation, range(10))

from the application perspective, ``x`` and ``y`` represent 
exactly the objects being returned by the ``longcomputation()``
invocations.  You can put these objects into a dictionary 
without triggering the computation:: 

    >>>> d = {5: x, 10: y}
    >>>> result = d[5]
    >>>> result
    computing...
    10
    >>>> type(d[10])
    computing...
    <type 'int'>
    >>>> d[10]
    45

It is interesting to note that this lazy-computing Python extension 
is solely implemented in a small `objspace/thunk.py`_ file consisting 
of around 100 lines of code. Since the 0.8.0 release it is even possible
to `translate PyPy with the thunk object space`_.

Running the tests
+++++++++++++++++

The PyPy project uses test-driven-development.  Right now, there are
a couple of different categories of tests which you can run.
To run all the unit tests::

    cd pypy
    python test_all.py

Alternatively, you may run subtests by going to the correct subdirectory
and running them individually::

    python test_all.py interpreter/test/test_pyframe.py

``test_all.py`` is actually just a synonym for `py.test`_ which is 
our external testing tool. If you have installed that you 
can as well just issue ``py.test DIRECTORY_OR_FILE`` in order 
to perform test runs or simply start it without arguments to 
run all tests below the current directory. 

Finally, there are the CPython regression tests which you can 
run like this (this will take hours and hours and hours)::

    cd lib-python/2.4.1/test 
    python ../../../pypy/test_all.py

or if you have `installed py.test`_ then you simply say::

    py.test

from the lib-python/2.4.1/test directory. You need to have a checkout of the
testresult directory. Running one of the above commands tells you how to
proceed.

.. _`installed py.test`: http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/getting-started.html

Demos
+++++

The `demo/`_ directory contains examples of various aspects of PyPy,
ranging from running regular Python programs (that we used as compliance goals) 
over experimental distribution mechanisms to examples translating 
sufficiently static programs into low level code. 

.. _`try out the translator`:

Trying out the translator
------------------------- 

The translator is a tool based on the PyPy interpreter which can translate
sufficiently static Python programs into low-level code. To be able to use it
you need to:

  * Download and install Pygame_ if you do not already have it.

  * Have an internet connection. The flowgraph viewer connects to
    codespeak.net and lets it convert the flowgraph by a patched version of
    `Dot Graphviz`_ that does not crash. This is only needed if you want to
    look at the flowgraphs.

To start the interactive translator shell do::

    cd pypy/bin
    python translatorshell.py

Test snippets of translatable code are provided in the file
``pypy/translator/test/snippet.py``, which is imported under the name
``snippet``.  For example::

    >>> t = Translation(snippet.is_perfect_number)
    >>> t.view()
        
After that, the graph viewer pops up, that lets you interactively inspect the
flowgraph. To move around, click on something that you want to inspect.
To get help about how to use it, press 'H'. To close it again, press 'Q'.

Trying out the type annotator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have a type annotator that can completely infer types for functions like
``is_perfect_number`` (as well as for much larger examples)::

    >>> t.annotate([int])
    >>> t.view()

Move the mouse over variable names (in red) to see their inferred types.


Translating the flow graph to C code
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The graph can be turned into C code::

   >>> t.rtype()
   >>> f = t.compile_c()

The first command replaces the operations with other low level versions that
only use low level types that are available in C (e.g. int). To try out the
compiled version::

   >>> f(5)
   False
   >>> f(6)
   True

.. _LLVM:

Translating the flow graph to LLVM code
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To translate for LLVM (`low level virtual machine`_) you must first have `LLVM
installed with version 1.7`_ - the `how to install LLVM`_ provides some helpful
hints.  Please note that you do not need the CFrontend to compile, make
tools-only.

The LLVM backend is still experimental.  However, it is very close to C backend
functionality. At the point of writing, it is mostly missing stackless and
threading support as well as the possibility to use reference counting. Calling
compiled LLVM code from CPython is more restrictive than the C backend - the
return type and the arguments of the entry function must be ints, floats or
bools.  The emphasis of the LLVM backend is to compile standalone executables -
please see the pypy/translator/llvm/demo directory for examples.

Here is a simple example to try::

   >>> t = Translation(snippet.my_gcd)
   >>> a = t.annotate([int, int])
   >>> t.rtype()
   >>> f = t.compile_llvm()
   >>> f(15, 10)
   5


Translating the flow graph to Javascript code
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Javascript backend is still experimental but will be worked on during this
years `Google summer of code`_. It contains some rudimentary support
for the document object model and a good integration with PyPy's unittesting
framework. Code can be tested with the `Spidermonkey`_ commandline javascript
interpreter in addition to a multitude of javascript capable browsers. 
The emphasis of the Javascript backend is to compile RPython code into
javascript snippets that can be used in a range of browsers. The goal is
to make it more and more capable to produce full featured web applications.
Please see the pypy/translator/js/test directory for example unittests.

Here is a simple example to try::

   >>> t = Translation(snippet.my_gcd)
   >>> a = t.annotate([int, int])
   >>> t.source_js()

A slightly larger example
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

There is a small-to-medium demo showing the translator and the annotator::

    cd demo
    python bpnn.py

This causes ``bpnn.py`` to display itself as a call graph and class
hierarchy.  Clicking on functions shows the flow graph of the particular
function.  Clicking on a class shows the attributes of its instances.  All
this information (call graph, local variables' types, attributes of
instances) is computed by the annotator.

As soon as you close the PyGame window, the function is turned into C code,
compiled and executed.

.. _`translate itself to lower level languages`: 

Translating the PyPy interpreter
--------------------------------

Not for the faint of heart nor the owner of a very old machine: you can
translate the whole of PyPy to low level C code. This is the largest and
ultimate example of source that our translation toolchain can process::

    cd pypy/translator/goal
    python translate.py --run

By default the translation process will try to use the
`Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector`_ for the translated PyPy (Use
``--gc=ref`` to use our own reference counting implementation which
at the moment is slower but doesn't have external dependencies).

This whole process will take some time and quite a lot of memory. To
reduce the memory footprint of the translation process you can use the
option ``--lowmem`` With this option the whole process should be
runnable on a machine with 512Mb of RAM. If the translation is
finished running and after you closed the graph you will be greeted
(because of ``--run`` option) by the friendly prompt of a PyPy
executable that is not running on top of CPython any more::

    [translation:info] created: ./pypy-c
    [translation:info] Running compiled c source...
    debug: entry point starting
    debug:  argv -> ./pypy-c
    debug: importing code
    debug: calling code.interact()
    Python 2.4.1 (pypy 0.7.1 build 18929) on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>>> 1 + 1
    2
    >>>> 

With the default options, you can find the produced executable under the
name ``pypy-c``.  Type ``pypy-c --help`` to see the options it supports --
mainly the same basic options of CPython.  In addition, ``pypy-c --info``
prints the translation options that where used to produce this particular
executable.  This executable contains a lot of things that are hard-coded
for your particular system (including paths), so it's not really meant to
be installed or redistributed at the moment.

If you exit the interpreter you get a pygame window with all the flowgraphs
plus a pdb prompt. Moving around in the resulting flow graph is difficult
because of the sheer size of the result. For this reason, the debugger prompt
you get at the end has been enhanced with commands to facilitate locating
functions and classes. Type ``help graphs`` for a list of the new commands.
Help is also available on each of these new commands.

The ``translate.py`` script itself takes a number of options controlling
what to translate and how.  See ``translate.py -h``. Some of the more
interesting options are:

   * ``--text``: don't show the flowgraph after the translation is done. This
     is useful if you don't have pygame installed.

   * ``--gc=boehm|ref``: choose between using the `Boehm-Demers-Weiser
     garbage collector`_ or our own reference counting implementation
     (as we have seen Boehm's collector is the default). 

You can also use the translate.py script to try out several smaller
programs, e.g. a slightly changed version of Pystone::

    cd pypy/translator/goal
    python translate.py targetrpystone


.. _`translate PyPy with the thunk object space`:

Translating with the thunk object space
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


It is also possible to experimentally translate a PyPy version using
the "thunk" object space::

    cd pypy/translator/goal
    python translate.py --run targetthunkstandalone

the examples in `lazily computed objects`_ should work in the translated
result.

Translating using the LLVM backend
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


To create a standalone executable using the experimental LLVM_ compiler
infrastructure::

    ./translate.py --text --batch --backend=llvm --raisingop2direct_call targetpypystandalone.py

.. _`start reading sources`: 

Where to start reading the sources
---------------------------------- 

PyPy is made from parts that are relatively independent from each other.
You should start looking at the part that attracts you most (all parts are
relative to the PyPy toplevel directory).  You may look at our `directory reference`_ 
or start off at one of the following points:

*  `pypy/interpreter`_ contains the bytecode interpreter: bytecode dispatcher
   in pyopcode.py_, frame and code objects in eval.py_ and pyframe.py_,
   function objects and argument passing in function.py_ and argument.py_,
   the object space interface definition in baseobjspace.py_, modules in
   module.py_ and mixedmodule.py_.  Core types supporting the bytecode 
   interpreter are defined in typedef.py_.

*  `pypy/interpreter/pyparser`_ contains a recursive descent parser,
   and input data files that allow it to parse both Python 2.3 and 2.4
   syntax.  Once the input data has been processed, the parser can be
   translated by the above machinery into efficient code.
 
*  `pypy/interpreter/astcompiler`_ contains the compiler.  This
   contains a modified version of the compiler package from CPython
   that fixes some bugs and is translatable.  That the compiler and
   parser are translatable is new in 0.8.0 and it makes using the
   resulting binary interactively much more pleasant.

*  `pypy/objspace/std`_ contains the `Standard object space`_.  The main file
   is objspace.py_.  For each type, the files ``xxxtype.py`` and
   ``xxxobject.py`` contain respectively the definition of the type and its
   (default) implementation.

*  `pypy/objspace`_ contains a few other object spaces: the thunk_,
   trace_ and flow_ object spaces.  The latter is a relatively short piece
   of code that builds the control flow graphs when the bytecode interpreter
   runs in it.

*  `pypy/translator`_ contains the code analysis and generation stuff.
   Start reading from translator.py_, from which it should be easy to follow
   the pieces of code involved in the various translation phases.

*  `pypy/annotation`_ contains the data model for the type annotation that
   can be inferred about a graph.  The graph "walker" that uses this is in
   `pypy/annotation/annrpython.py`_.

*  `pypy/rpython`_ contains the code of the RPython typer. The typer transforms
   annotated flow graphs in a way that makes them very similar to C code so
   that they can be easy translated. The graph transformations are controlled
   by the stuff in `pypy/rpython/rtyper.py`_. The object model that is used can
   be found in `pypy/rpython/lltypesystem/lltype.py`_. For each RPython type
   there is a file rxxxx.py that contains the low level functions needed for
   this type.

.. _optionaltool: 

Additional Tools for running (and hacking) PyPy 
-----------------------------------------------

We use some optional tools for developing PyPy. They are not required to run 
the basic tests or to get an interactive PyPy prompt but they help to
understand  and debug PyPy especially for the ongoing translation work.  

graphviz & pygame for flowgraph viewing (highly recommended)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

graphviz and pygame are both neccessary if you
want to look at generated flowgraphs: 

	graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php 

	pygame: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

CLISP
+++++++

The CLISP backend is optional and not quite uptodate with the rest of
PyPy. Still there are a few examples you can try our backend out on. 
Here is a link to a LISP implementation that should basically work: 

    http://clisp.cons.org/ 


.. _`py.test`:  

py.test and the py lib 
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The `py library`_ is used for supporting PyPy development and 
running our tests against code and documentation as well as
compliance tests.  You don't need to install the py library because 
it ships with PyPy and `pypy/test_all.py`_ is an alias for ``py.test``
but if you want to have the ``py.test`` tool generally in your 
path, you might like to visit: 

    http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/getting-started.html



Getting involved 
================================== 

PyPy employs an open development process.  You are invited to join our
`pypy-dev mailing list`_ or look at the other `contact
