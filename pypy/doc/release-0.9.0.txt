pypy-0.9.0: 
==============================================================

The PyPy development team has been busy working and we've now packaged 
our latest improvements, completed work and new experiments as 
version 0.9.0, our fourth public release.

The highlights of this fourth release of PyPy are:

  - stackless

    - extended app-level interface
    - tasklet pickling

  - ext-compiler

  - rctypes

  - framework gcs

  - __del__/weakref/__subclasses__

  - logic space preview

  - high level backends preview

  - bugfixes, better performance

     - 2.5-3x times faster than 0.8 (on richards and pystone).
     - pypy-c can complete CPython's test suite

  - some other stuff

    - some 2.5 features?

XXX clearly needs expansion

What is PyPy (about)? 
------------------------------------------------

PyPy is a MIT-licensed research-oriented reimplementation of Python
written in Python itself, flexible and easy to experiment with.  It
translates itself to lower level languages.  Our goals are to target a
large variety of platforms, small and large, by providing a
compilation toolsuite that can produce custom Python versions.
Platform, memory and threading models are to become aspects of the
translation process - as opposed to encoding low level details into
the language implementation itself.  Eventually, dynamic optimization
techniques - implemented as another translation aspect - should become
robust against language changes.

Note that PyPy is mainly a research and development project and does
not by itself focus on getting a production-ready Python
implementation although we do hope and expect it to become a viable
contender in that area sometime next year.

PyPy is partially funded as a research project under the European
Union's IST programme.

Where to start? 
-----------------------------

Getting started:    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html

PyPy Documentation: http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/ 

PyPy Homepage:      http://codespeak.net/pypy/

The interpreter and object model implementations shipped with the 0.9
version can run on their own and implement the core language features
of Python as of CPython 2.4.  However, we still do not recommend using
PyPy for anything else than for education, playing or research
purposes.

Project Details
---------------

PyPy has been developed during approximately 20 coding sprints across
Europe and the US.  It continues to be a very dynamically and
incrementally evolving project with many of these one-week workshops
to follow.

PyPy has been a community effort from the start and it would
not have got that far without the coding and feedback support
from numerous people.   Please feel free to give feedback and 
raise questions.

have fun, 
    
    the pypy team, (Armin Rigo, Samuele Pedroni, 
    Holger Krekel, Christian Tismer, 
    Carl Friedrich Bolz, Michael Hudson, 
    and many others: http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/contributor.html)

PyPy development and activities happen as an open source project  
and with the support of a consortium partially funded by a two 
year European Union IST research grant. The full partners of that 
consortium are: 
        
    Heinrich-Heine University (Germany), AB Strakt (Sweden)
    merlinux GmbH (Germany), tismerysoft GmbH (Germany) 
    Logilab Paris (France), DFKI GmbH (Germany)
    ChangeMaker (Sweden), Impara (Germany)
