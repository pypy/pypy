This document gives an overview of the goals and architecture of PyPy.
See `getting started`_ for a practical introduction and starting points. 

Mission statement 
====================

We aim to provide:

* a common translation framework for generating interpreters
  and implementations of dynamic languages, supporting a clean separation 
  between language specification and implementation aspects. 

* a compliant and fast Python Language interpreter 
  enabling new advanced features without the requirement
  to encode low level details into it. 

The choice of target platform as well as advanced optimisations 
techniques are to become aspects of the translation process, up
to the ultimate point of *generating Just-in-Time compilers* 
for dynamic language interpreters. 


High Level Goals
=============================

PyPy - The Translation Framework 
-----------------------------------------------

Traditionally, language interpreters are written in a target platform language
like C/Posix, Java or C#.  Each such implementation fundamentally provides 
a mapping from application source code to the target environment.  One of 
the goals of the "all-encompassing" environments, like the .NET framework
and to some extent the Java virtual machine, is to provide standardized
and higher level functionalities in order to support language implementors
for writing language implementations. 

PyPy is experimenting with a more ambitious approach.  We are using a
subset of a VHLL language, called RPython, to specify languages
without many references and dependencies to lower level details,
leaving it to the translation framework to add these as translation
aspects and produce custom implementations for particular feature
and platform configurations.  

Particularly, we want to help avoiding having to write ``n * m * o``
interpreters for ``n`` dynamic languages and ``m`` platforms
with ``o`` crucial design decisions.  PyPy aims at having any
one of these parameters changeable independently from each
other:

* ``n``: modify or replace the language we analyse and regenerate
  a concrete interpreter for each target;

* ``m``: write new translator back-ends to target new
  physical and virtual platforms;

* ``o``: tweak and optimize the translation process to produce 
  platform specific code based on different models and tradeoffs.

By contrast, a standardized target environment - say .NET -
enforces ``m=1`` as far as it's concerned.  This helps making ``o`` a
bit smaller by providing a higher-level base to build upon.  Still,
we believe that enforcing the use of one common environment 
is not necessary.  PyPy's goal is to give weight to this claim - at least 
as far as language implementation is concerned - showing an approach
to the ``n * m * o`` problem that does not rely on standardization.

Particularly, we set ourselves the goal to *generate
Just-In-Time Compilers* in addition to traditional
Interpreter implementations - an area of language
implementation that is commonly considered the ultimate 
in complexity. 


PyPy - the Python Interpreter 
--------------------------------------------

Our goal is to provide a full featured, customizable and fast Python
implementation, written in a subset of Python itself, working on and interacting 
with a large variety of platforms and allowing to quickly introduce 
new advanced language features. 

The architecture and abstractions of PyPy's "Python language specification" 
aim to enable new implementation and optimization features that 
tradtionally require pervasive changes in a language implementation 
source code. 

An important aspect of implementing Python in RPython is the high level of
abstraction and compactness of the language. This allows an implementation
that is, in many respects, easier to understand and play with than the one
written in C (referred to throughout the PyPy documentation and source as
"CPython").

Another goal is to specify the language implementation in the form
of a number of independent modules and abstractions, with clearly defined and 
automatically tested API's.  This eases reuse and allows experimenting with 
variations and combinations of features. 

Our Python language implementation architecture, however, also serves as a 
key part for the translation framework:  we re-use its bytecode evaluator 
to analyse RPython programs, PyPy's implementation language for specifying 
language semantics and interpretation. 


PyPy Architecture 
===========================

As you would expect from a project implemented using ideas from the world
of `Extreme Programming`_, the architecture of PyPy has evolved over time
and continues to evolve.  Nevertheless, the high level architecture is 
stable. There are two rather independent basic subsystems: the `Python 
Interpreter`_ and `the Translation Framework`_.  We first talk about the 
Python Interpreter because the Translation framework in fact re-uses 
parts of its architecture and code. 

.. _`standard interpreter`: 

The Python Interpreter
-------------------------------------

The *Python Interpreter* is the subsystem implementing the Python language
with the following key components: 

- a bytecode compiler responsible for producing Python Code objects 

- a `bytecode evaluator`_ responsible for interpreting 
  Python code objects. 

- an `standard object space`_ responsible for creating, accessing and
  modifying Python application level objects.  

The *bytecode evaluator* is the part that interprets the compact
bytecode format produced from user Python sources by a preprocessing
phase, the *bytecode compiler*.  The bytecode compiler itself is
implemented as a chain of flexible passes (tokenizer, lexer, parser,
abstract syntax tree builder, bytecode generator).  The bytecode
evaluator does its work by delegating all actual manipulation of
user objects to the *object space*.  The latter can be thought of as the
library of built-in types.  It defines the implementation of the user
objects, like integers and lists, as well as the operations between
them, like addition or truth-value-testing.  

This division between bytecode evaluator and object space is very
important, as it gives a lot of flexibility. It is possible to use
different `object spaces`_ to get different behaviours of the Python
objects.  Using a special object space is also an important technique
for our translation process.

The Translation Process
-----------------------

The *translation process* is implemented in four parts: 

- producing a *flow graph* representation of an RPython program source, 
  A combination of the `bytecode evaluator`_ and a *flow object space*
  performs `abstract interpretation`_ to record the flow of objects
  and execution throughout a python program into such a *flow graph*;

- the *annotator* which performs type inference on the flow graph;

- the *typer* which, based on the type annotations, turns the flow graph
  into another representation fitting the model of the target platform;

- the *backend* which emits code for and integrates with the target platform. 

.. _`initialization time`:
.. _`translation process in more details`:

In order for our generic translation and type inference mechanisms to
master complexity, we restrict the dynamism of our source
RPython program, using a particularly dynamic definition of RPython_. 
During initialization the source program can make unrestricted 
use of Python (including metaclasses and execution of dynamically 
constructed strings).  However, Python code objects that we eventually
see during the production and analysis of flow graphs, must adhere
to a more static subset of Python.  

The `bytecode evaluator`_ and the Flow Object Space work through 
those initialized RPython code objects.  The result of this 
`abstract interpretation`_ is a flow graph: yet another
representation of the source program, but one which is suitable for
applying translation and type inference techniques.  The nodes of the
graph are basic blocks consisting of Object Space operations, flowing
of values, and an exitswitch to one, two or multiple links which connect
each basic block to other basic blocks. 

The flow graphs are fed as input into the Annotator.  The Annotator,
given entry point types, infers the types of values that flow through
the program variables.  RPython code is restricted in such a way that the
Annotator is able to infer consistent types.  How much dynamism we allow in 
RPython depends on, and is mostly restricted by, the Flow Object Space and 
the Annotator implementation.  The more we can improve this translation 
phase, the more dynamism we can allow.  

The *Typer* is responsible to prepare and produce target platform specific 
representations of the annotated high level RPython flowgraphs.  It visits 
the flowgraphs in order to transform and amend its contained operations 
into specialized representations, suitable for either high level or 
low level platforms.  High level platforms usually have their own 
garbace collectors and high level builtin types, while low level platforms
require dealing with machine level types and pointers. 

The actual target platform code is eventually emitted by 
the backend through "visiting" the type-annontated flow graph
and adding platform specific integration code.
