Independent project ideas relating to PyPy
==========================================

PyPy allows experimentation in many directions -- indeed facilitating
experimentation in language implementation was one of the main
motivations for the project.  This page is meant to collect some ideas
of experiments that the core developers have not had time to perform
yet and also do not require too much in depth knowledge to get started
with.

Feel free to suggest new ideas and discuss them in #pypy on the freenode IRC
network or the pypy-dev mailing list (see the contact_ page).

Experiment with optimizations
-----------------------------

Although PyPy's Python interpreter is very compatible with CPython, it is not
yet as fast.  There are several approaches to making it faster, including the
on-going Just-In-Time compilation efforts and improving the compilation tool
chain, but probably the most suited to being divided into reasonably sized
chunks is to play with alternate implementations of key data structures or
algorithms used by the interpreter.  PyPy's structure is designed to make this
straightforward, so it is easy to provide a different implementation of, say,
dictionaries or lists without disturbing any other code.

As examples, we've got working implementations of things like:

* lazy string slices (slicing a string gives an object that references a part
  of the original string).

* lazily concatenated strings (repeated additions and joins are done
  incrementally).

* dictionaries specialized for string-only keys.

* dictionaries which use a different strategy when very small.

* caching the lookups of builtin names (by special forms of
  dictionaries that can invalidate the caches when they are written to)

Things we've thought about but not yet implemented include:

* create multiple representations of Unicode string that store the character
  data in narrower arrays when they can.

Experiments of this kind are really experiments in the sense that we do not know
whether they will work well or not and the only way to find out is to try.  A
project of this nature should provide benchmark results (both timing and memory
usage) as much as code.

Some ideas on concrete steps for benchmarking:

* find a set of real-world applications that can be used as benchmarks
  for pypy (ideas: docutils, http://hachoir.org/, moinmoin, ...?)

* do benchmark runs to see how much speedup the currently written
  optimizations give
* profile pypy-c and its variants with these benchmarks, identify slow areas

* try to come up with optimized implementations for these slow areas

Start or improve a back-end
---------------------------

PyPy has complete, or nearly so, back-ends for C, LLVM, CLI/.NET and
JVM. It would be an interesting project to improve either of these
partial backends, or start one for another platform (Objective C comes
to mind as one that should not be too terribly hard).

Improve JavaScript backend
--------------------------

The JavaScript backend is somehow different from other pypy's backends because
it does not try to support all of PyPy (where it might be run then?), but rather
to compile RPython programs into code that runs in a browser.  Some documents
are in `what is PyPy.js`_ file and `using the JavaScript backend`_. Some project
ideas might be:

* Write some examples to show different possibilities of using the backend.

* Improve the facilities for testing RPython intended to be translated to
  JavaScript on top of CPython, mostly by improving existing DOM interface.

* Write down the mochikit bindings (or any other interesting JS effects library),
  including tests

* Write down better object layer over DOM in RPython to make writing applications
  easier

Improve one of the JIT back-ends
--------------------------------

PyPy's Just-In-Time compiler relies on two assembler backends for actual code
generation, one for PowerPC and the other for i386. Idea would be start a new backend
for ie. mobile device.

Another idea in a similar vein would be to use LLVM to re-compile functions that
are executed particularly frequently (LLVM cannot be used for *all* code
generation, since it can only work on function at a time).

Write a new front end
---------------------

Write an interpreter for **another dynamic language** in the PyPy framework.
For example, a Scheme interpreter would be suitable (and it would even be
interesting from a semi-academic point of view to see if ``call/cc`` can be
implemented on top of the primitives the stackless transform provides).  Ruby
too (though the latter is probably more than two months of work), or Lua, or ...

We already have a somewhat usable `Prolog interpreter`_ and the beginnings of a
`JavaScript interpreter`_.

.. _security:

Investigate restricted execution models
---------------------------------------

Revive **rexec**\ : implement security checks, sandboxing, or some similar
model within PyPy (which, if I may venture an opinion, makes more sense and is
more robust than trying to do it in CPython).

There are multiple approaches that can be discussed and tried.  One of them is
about safely executing limited snippets of untrusted RPython code (see
http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2006q2/003131.html).  More general
approaches, to execute general but untrusted Python code on top of PyPy,
require more design.  The object space model of PyPy will easily allow
objects to be tagged and tracked.  The translation of PyPy would also be a
good place to insert e.g. systematic checks around all system calls.

.. _distribution:
.. _persistence:

Experiment with distribution and persistence
--------------------------------------------

One of the advantages of PyPy's implementation is that the Python-level type
of an object and its implementation are completely independent.  This should
allow a much more intuitive interface to, for example, objects that are backed
by a persistent store.

The `transparent proxy`_ objects are a key step in this
direction; now all that remains is to implement the interesting bits :-)

An example project might be to implement functionality akin to the `ZODB's
Persistent class`_, without the need for the _p_changed hacks, and in pure
Python code (should be relatively easy on top of transparent proxy).

Numeric/NumPy/numarray support
------------------------------

At the EuroPython sprint, some work was done on making RPython's annotator
recognise Numeric arrays, with the goal of allowing programs using them to be
efficiently translated.  It would be a reasonably sized project to finish this
work, i.e. allow RPython programs to use some Numeric facilities.
Additionally, these facilities could be exposed to applications interpreted by
the translated PyPy interpreter.

Extension modules
-----------------

Rewrite one or several CPython extension modules to be based on **ctypes**
(integrated in Python 2.5): this is generally useful for Python
developers, and it is now the best path to write extension modules that are
compatible with both CPython and PyPy.  This is done with the `extension
compiler`_ component of PyPy, which will likely require some attention as
well.

Modules where some work is already done:

* ``_socket``, ``os``, ``select`` (unfinished yet, feel free to help;
  see e.g. http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist/pypy/module/_socket/).

* SSL for socket, ``bz2``, ``fcntl``, ``mmap`` and ``time``: part of the
  Summer of Code project of Lawrence Oluyede
  (http://codespeak.net/svn/user/rhymes/).

You are free to pick any other CPython module, either standard or third-party
(if relatively well-known, like gtk bindings).
Note that some modules exist in a ctypes version
already, which would be a good start for porting them to PyPy's extension
compiler.

Extend py.execnet to a peer-to-peer model
-----------------------------------------

* Work on a P2P model of distributed execution (extending `py.execnet`_) 
  that allows `py.test`_ and other upcoming utilities to make use of a 
  network of computers executing python tasks (e.g. tests or PyPy build tasks). 

* Make a client tool and according libraries to instantiate a (dynamic) network
  of computers executing centrally managed tasks (e.g. build or test ones). 
  (This may make use of a P2P model or not, both is likely feasible). 

Or else...
----------

* Constraint programming: `efficient propagators for specialized
  finite domains`_ (like numbers, sets, intervals).

* A `code templating solution`_ for Python code, allowing to extend
  the language syntax, control flow operators, etc.

...or whatever else interests you!

Feel free to mention your interest and discuss these ideas on the `pypy-dev
mailing list`_.  You can also have a look around our documentation_.
