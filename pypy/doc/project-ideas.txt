Independent project ideas relating to PyPy
==========================================

PyPy allows experimentation in many directions -- indeed facilitating
experimentation in language implementation was one of the main
motivations for the project.  This page is meant to collect some ideas
of experiments that the core developers have not had time to perform
yet and also do not require too much in depth knowledge to get started
with.

Feel free to suggest new ideas and discuss them in #pypy on the freenode IRC
network or the pypy-dev mailing list (see the home_ page).

JIT back-ends
--------------------------------

PyPy's Just-In-Time compiler relies on backends for actual code
generation.  We have so far a 32-bit Intel backend, and a CLI one.  Open
ideas are to write a backend for **Intel 64** (AMD64); or a backend for
Java; or trying again to use LLVM-JIT (which I do not really recommend).

CTypes
------

Support ctypes on more backends.  Right now ctypes is supported only
when compiling PyPy to C, and there is a bit of unfinished work to
support it on **Intel 64.**  A nice project would be to support it when
compiling to .NET or the JVM. That's not too hard, the only thing needed
is to port a small module that does the actual invocation of external
libraries (a related project is to port this module to Jython or
IronPython to get support for ctypes there, which is something that was
tried but not finished as far as I know).

One of the advantages of PyPy's implementation is that the Python-level type
of an object and its implementation are completely independent.  This should
allow a much more intuitive interface to, for example, objects that are backed
by a persistent store.  The `transparent proxy`_ objects are a key step in this
direction; now all that remains is to implement the interesting bits :-)

An example project might be to implement functionality akin to the `ZODB's
Persistent class`_, without the need for the _p_changed hacks, and in pure
Python code (should be relatively easy on top of transparent proxy).

Another example would be to implement a multi-CPU extension that internally
uses several processes and uses transparent proxies to share object views.

Other ideas are to do something interesting with sandboxing_; or to
work more on the Stackless_ features (e.g. integrate it with the JIT);
or revive the logic object space, which tried to bring unification-like
features to Python.

Other languages
---------------

Improve one of the `existing interpreters`__, or start a new one.
Experiment with the JIT compiler generator.
