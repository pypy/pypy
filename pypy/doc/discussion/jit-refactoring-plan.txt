Rainbow Interpreter
===================

    - bytecode: linearize hintannotated low-level exceptionstransformed graphs
      into a datastructure containing a bytecode string (the opcodes) and
      constants
 
    - opcodes:

        - all basics operations in red and green variants

        - additional operations for JIT housekeeping like split, merge,
          promote, calls?, return, box_green_var

    - special care needed (later) for implicit promotes (e.g. for exception
      paths and virtualizables)

    - red variables are boxes, already stored on the VirtualFrame
    
    - green variables are GenConsts, should be stored on the VirtualFrame as
      well

    - variables are valid for one block, renaming op (with variable number of
      args)
    
    - interpreter is manually written in a stackless style: jitstates have
      linked lists of frames anyway already


"Plan B" Control Flow
---------------------

A few notes about a refactoring that I was thinking about for after the
rainbow interpreter works nicely.  Let's use the Python interpreter as a
motivating example.

* hot path: for a frequently-executed Python opcode in a certain
  function in the user program, the "hot path" is the path in the
  interpreter that is generally followed for this particular opcode.
  Opposite: "cold path".

The current approach tends to produce far too much machine code at
run-time - many cold paths give machine code.  So let's see what would
be involved in producing as little machine code as possible (maybe
that's the opposite extreme and some middle path would be better).
While we're at it let's include the question of how to produce machine
code for only the relevant parts of the user program.

Hints
++++++++++++++++

We'd replace portals and global merge points with the following variant:
two hints, "jit_can_enter" and "jit_can_leave", which are where the
execution can go from interpreter to JITted and back.  The idea is that
"jit_can_leave" is present at the beginning of the main interpreter loop
-- i.e. it is a global merge point.

The other hint, "jit_can_enter", is the place where some lightweight
profiling occurs in order to know if we should enter the JIT.  It's
important to not have one "jit_can_enter" for each opcode -- that's a
too heavy slow-down for regularly interpreted code (but it would be
correct too).  A probably reasonable idea is to put it in the opcodes
that close loops (JUMP_ABSOLUTE, CONTINUE).  This would make the regular
Python interpreter try to start JITting the Python-level loops that are
often executed.  (In time, the JIT should follow calls too, so that
means that the functions called by loops also get JITted.)

If the profiling in "jit_can_enter" finds out we should start JITting,
it calls the JIT, which compiles and executes some machine code, which
makes the current function frame progress, maybe to its end or not, but
at least to an opcode boundary; so when the call done by "jit_can_enter"
returns the regular interpreter can simply continue from the new next
opcode.  For this reason it's necessary to put "jit_can_enter" and
"jit_can_leave" next to each other, control-flow-wise --
i.e. "jit_can_enter" should be at the end of JUMP_ABSOLUTE and CONTINUE,
so that they are immediately followed by the global "jit_can_leave".

Note that "jit_can_enter", in the regular interpreter, has another goal
too: it should quickly check if machine code was already emitted for the
next opcode, and if so, jump to it -- i.e. do a call to it.  As above
the call to the machine code will make the current function execution
progress and when it returns we can go on interpreter it.

PyPy contains some custom logic to virtualize the frame and the value
stack; in this new model it should go somewhere related to
"jit_can_enter".

The "jit_can_enter" hint becomes nothing in the rainbow interpreter's
bytecode.  Conversely, the "jit_can_leave" hint becomes nothing in
the regular interpreter, but an important bytecode in the rainbow
bytecode -- a global merge point.

Very lazy code generation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now to the controversial part (if the above wasn't already).  The idea
is for the JIT to be as lazy as possible producing machine code.  The
simplest approach allows us to always maintain a single JITState, never
a chained list of pending-to-be-compiled JITStates.  (Note that this is
not *necessary*; it's quite possible that it's better to combine
approaches and compile things a bit more eagerly along several paths.
I'm mostly decribing the other extreme here.)

The basic idea is to stop compiling early, and wait before execution
actually followed one of the possible paths often enough before
continuing.  "Early" means at some red splits and all promotions.  The
picture is that the JIT should compile a single straight-code path
corresponding to maybe half an opcode or a few opcodes, and then wait;
then compile a bit more, and wait; and progress like this.  In this
model we get the nice effect that in a Python-level loop, we would end
up compiling only the loop instead of the whole function that contains
it: indeed, the "jit_can_enter" profiling only triggers on the start of
the loop, and the stop-early logic means that the path that exits the
loop is cold and will not be compiled.

Red splits and promotions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We would identify two kinds of red splits: the ones that just correspond
to "simple if-then-else" patterns; and the "complicated" ones.  We can
be more clever about simple if-then-else patterns, but for all other red
splits, we would just stop emitting machine code.  The JIT puts in the
machine code a jump to a special "fall-back rainbow interpreter".  This
interpreter is a variant that considers everything as green and just
interprets everything normally.  The idea is that when execution reaches
the red split, in the middle of the rainbow bytecode of whatever
function of the Python interpreter, we only want to produce more machine
code for the hot path; so we have to do something to continue executing
when we don't want to generate more code immediately.

The "something" in question, the fall-back rainbow interpreter, is quite
slow, but only runs until the end of the current opcode and can directly
perform all nested calls instead of interpreting them.  When it reaches
the "jit_can_leave", it then returns; as described in the "hints"
section this should be a return from the initial call to the JIT or the
machine code -- a call which was in "jit_can_enter" in the regular
interpreter.  So the control flow is now in the regular interpreter,
which can go on interpreting at its normal speed from there.

All in all I guess that there is a chance that the fallback rainbow
interpreter is not too much of an overhead.  The important point is that
whenever we use the fallback rainbow interpreter, we also update
counters, and when enough executions have been seen, we compile the hot
path (and only the hot path, unless we find out quickly that the other
path is hot enough too).  So after the compilation converges overall,
the fallback rainbow interpreter is only ever executed on the cold
paths.

As noted above, we can (later) be clever about simple if-then-else
patterns, and always immediately compile both branches.  If we still
want a single JITState, we need to make sure that it's a good idea to
always merge the two states at the end of the two branches; a criteria
could be that an if-then-else is "simple enough" if the branches contain
no allocation (i.e. no potential new virtual stuff that could raise
DontMerge in the current rvalue.py).  This should be good enough to
directly compile machine code like::

    x = 5
    if condition:
        x += 1
    do_more_stuff

Promotions are similar to red splits -- go to the fall-back rainbow
interpreter, which update counters, and later resumes compilation for
the values that seem to be hot.  For further improvements, this also
makes it easy to decide, looking at the counters, that a site is
"megamorphic", i.e. receives tons of different values with no clear
winner.  For this case we can really compile a megamorphic path where
the promotion did not occur (i.e. the value stays as a red variable
after all).  The megamorphic path is "hot", in a sense, so compiling for
it puts the fallback rainbow interpreter out of the hot path again.

About calls: non-residual calls would always just return a single
JITState in this simplified model, so no need for the careful red/yellow
call logic (at least for now).  Residual calls, like now, would be
followed by the equivalent of a promotion, checking if the residual call
caused an exception or forced devirtualization.

About local merge points: in this model of a single JITState, I vaguely
suspect that it gives better results to have *less* local merge points,
e.g. only at the beginning of local loops.  To be experimented with.  It
might remove the need for the DontMerge exception and the need to
maintain (and linearly scan through) more than one state per green key.
