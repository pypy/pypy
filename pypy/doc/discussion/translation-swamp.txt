List of things that need to be improved for translation to be saner
===================================================================


 * understand nondeterminism after rtyping
 
 * nondeterminism of insert stackcheck:

    * move it after inlining
    * avoid inserting it multiple times in the same block

 * experiment with different heuristics:
 
    * weight backedges more
    * consider size of outer function
    * consider number of arguments

 * find a more deterministic inlining order (number of calls?)

 * experiment with using a base inlining threshold and then drive inlining by
   malloc removal possibilities (using escape analysis)

 * move the inlining of gc helpers just before emitting the code.
   throw the graph away

 * for gcc: use just one implement file
