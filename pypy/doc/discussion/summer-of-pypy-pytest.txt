============================================
Summer of PyPy proposal: Distributed py.test
============================================


Purpose:
========

The main purpose of distributing py.test is to speedup tests
of actual applications (running all pypy tests already takes
ages).

Method:
=======

XXX: some draft

- remote import (which I've already implemented)
- run on session level probably (like RemoteSession)
- do not run on low level (around `call(*args)`) [previous,
  Executor approach], because there are problems with displaying and
  we need everything to get every data.
- We need to get data on higher level - perform remote import of py lib
  and run session there (ServerSession or so) to send data to client
  and get info. Probably more sophisticated stuff such as PDB, or any other
  input will get run by re-running test on client side (transfering every pdb
  call seems hard and what if they implement readline-like approach in pdb?)

XXX: Remote import, how it works

Sending data as new files. Possible additions of some kind of checksums.
