=======================
The ``__pypy__`` module
=======================

The ``__pypy__`` module is the main entry point to special features provided
by PyPy's standard interpreter. Its content depends on `configuration options`_ 
which may add new functionality and functions whose existence or non-existence 
indicates the presence of such features. 

.. _`configuration options`: config/index.html

Generally available functionality
=================================

 - ``internal_repr(obj)``: return the interpreter-level representation of an
   object.

Thunk Object Space Functionality
================================

When the thunk object space is used (choose with :config:`objspace.name`),
the following functions are put into ``__pypy__``:

 - ``thunk(f, *args, **kwargs)``: returns something that behaves like the result
   of the call ``f(*args, **kwargs)`` but the call is done lazily.

 - ``is_thunk(obj)``: return True if ``obj`` is a thunk that is not computed
   yet.

 - ``become(obj1, obj2)``: globally replace ``obj1`` with ``obj2``.

 - ``lazy(callable)``: Should be used as a function decorator. The decorated
   function behaves lazily: all calls to it return a thunk object.

For explanations and examples see the `thunk object space docs`_.

Transparent Proxy Functionality
===============================

If `transparent proxies`_ are enabled (with :config:`objspace.std.withtproxy`)
the following functions are put into ``__pypy__``:

 - ``tproxy(typ, controller)``: Return something that looks like it is of type
   typ. Its behaviour is completely controlled by the controller. See the docs
   about `transparent proxies`_ for detail.

 - ``get_tproxy_controller(obj)``: If obj is really a transparent proxy, return
   its controller. Otherwise return None.

.. _`transparent proxies`: objspace-proxies.html#tproxy


Functionality available on py.py
================================

 - ``isfake(obj)``: returns True if ``obj`` is faked.

 - ``interp_pdb()``: start a pdb at interpreter-level.
