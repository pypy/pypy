JS-PyPy: PyPy's Javascript interpreter
======================================


The pypy Javascript interpreter was written by Leonardo Santagada with the
help of most of the pypy team and is his summer of pypy project. It aims to
show how to implement a clear interpreter on the pypy plataform, and providing
support for some facilities not common to javascript interpreters.

To run the js interpreter you will need the spidermonkey binary in the path
(or in the same directory in windows). It does have a interactive interpreter
for you to play with, but it is made in pure python (not rpython) so it isn't
present on the translated interpreter


Translating the interpreter to C
================================

Just as you can translate PyPy's Python interpreter, you can also translate the
Javascript interpreter to C::

    pypy$ cd translator/goal
    pypy/translator/goal$ python translate.py targetjsstandalone.py

The translated interpreter is not interactive, you can only pass a javascript
file for execution.

Examples
========

This examples are made using the interactive interpreter js_interactive.py,
but you can save the code to a file and run it on the translated interpreter.

To start the basics, open the interactive interpreter::

	pypy/lang/js$ ./py_interactive.py
	js-pypy> print("hello world") // the classic example
	hello world
	js-pypy> x = 3+5*2 // arithimetic expressions
	1
	js-pypy> x = "Hello" + " " + "World" // string manipulation
	"Hello World"
	js-pypy> function f(n) { // functions works
	     ...   return n+1;
	     ... }
	[object Object]
	js-pypy> f(13)
	14
	js-pypy> 

some more complex examples::

	js-pypy> function fact(n) { // recursive functions, this is a factorial
	     ...   if (n==0) {
	     ...     return 1;
	     ...   }
	     ...   else {
	     ...     return n*fact(n-1);
	     ...   }
	     ... }
	[object Object]
	js-pypy> fact(3)
	6
	js-pypy> function fact(n) {
	     ...   if (n==0) {
	     ...     return 1;
	     ...   }
	     ...   else {
	     ...     return n*fact(n-1);
	     ...   }
	     ... }
	[object Object]
	js-pypy> fact(3)
	6

	js-pypy> function sumclosure(number) { // closures are supported also
	     ...   return function (n) { return number+n }
	     ... }
	[object Object]
	js-pypy> sum5 = sumclosure(5)
	[object Object]
	js-pypy> sum5(4)
	9
	js-pypy> 

Conclusions
===========

The interpreter is working but it is not complete, start playing with it and
fixing bugs and adding features should be easy as the code is still very
small, mostly it is defined in:

* interpreter.py: main interpreter and builtins
* operations.py: operations and all the nodes that can be interpreted (hint:
  the place to implement the switch statement)
* jsobj.py: primitive types and objects of javascript
