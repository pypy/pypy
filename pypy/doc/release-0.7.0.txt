PyPy-0.7.0: first self-contained Python Implementation 
==============================================================

The PyPy Development Team is happy to announce its first 
public release of a fully translatable self contained Python 
implementation. The 0.7 release is a preview release showcasing the
results of our efforts in the last few months:

- full program type inference with full translation 
  to two different machine-level targets: C and LLVM 

- the ability to translate with thread support or without 

- a translation choice of using a reference counting or Boehm 
  garbage collector 

- very high compliancy with Python 2.4.1 (fully based on 
  new style classes) 

What is PyPy (about)? 
------------------------------------------------

PyPy is an MIT-licensed reimplementation of Python written in Python
itself, flexible and easy to experiment with.  It translates itself
to lower level languages.  Our long-term goals are to target a large
variety of platforms, small and large, by providing a compiler toolsuite
that can produce custom Python versions. Platform, Memory and Threading
models are to become aspects of the translation process - as opposed to
encoding low level details into a language implementation itself.
Eventually, dynamic optimization techniques - implemented as another
translation aspect - should become robust against language changes.

Where to start? 
-----------------------------

Getting started:    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html

The interpreter and object model implementations shipped with 0.7 can
run on their own and implement the core language features of
Python as of CPython 2.4.  However, we do not recommend using 
PyPy for anything else than for playing or research purposes.  

Ongoing work and near term goals
---------------------------------

XXX 

PyPy has been a community effort from the start and it would
not have got that far without the coding and feedback support
from numerous people.   Please feel free to give feedback and 
raise questions.
