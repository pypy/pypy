pypy-0.99.0: new object spaces, optimizations, configuration ... 
======================================================================

Welcome to the PyPy 0.99.0 release - a major snapshot
and milestone of the last 8 months of work and contributions 
since PyPy-0.9.0 came out in June 2006!

Main entry points: 

    XXX getting-started
    XXX downloads
    XXX index 

Further below you'll find notes on our current 
project view, a list of 0.99.0 highlights, and 
plans for PyPy 1.0 and beyond. 

have fun,

What and where is PyPy? 
==========================

Technically, PyPy is both a Python Interpreter implementation 
and an advanced Compiler, actually a framework for implementing 
dynamic languages and generating virtual machines for them.

The Python Standard interpreter provides compliant CPython 
semantics with a high flexibility for extending and
amending it.  We belive that the main issue keeping it from
being usable as a productive alternative is the 
lack of extension module support.  This will likely be 
an ongoing topic for 2007, as it is less of a research
topic and has thus been of less priority to the core
people involved with the EU project. 

The Compiler Framework allows for alternative frontends and
for alternative backends, currently C, LLVM, and .NET.  For
our main target "C", the Compiler can mixin different Garbage
Collectors and threading models, including micro-threads aka
"Stackless".  The inherent complexity that arises from this
ambitious approach is mostly kept away from the standard
interpreter implementation, the main frontend. 

If you want to compare PyPy-the-Compiler with something
else,  please pick a compiler that shares these goals and
don't forget to tell us about what you find out :) 

Socially, PyPy is a collaborative effort of many individuals, 
companies and universities, working together in a distributed
and sprint-driven way since 2003. 

Formally, many of us are involved in being a contract
partner of an EU contract with the goal to explore and
research new approaches to Language/Compiler development and
software engeneering.  This contract's duration is about to
end March 2007 and we are working and preparing the according
"final review" which is scheduled for May 2007.  


Key 0.99.0 Features 
=====================

* new object spaces:
  - Tainting: a 150-line proxy object space tracking 
    and boxing sensitive information within an application. 
    A tainted object is completely barred from crossing 
    an IO barrier, such as writing to files, databases
    or sockets.  This allows to   to significantly reduce the 
    effort of e.g. security reviews to the few places where 
    objects are "declassified" in order to send information 
    across IO barriers. 

  - TProxy: Transparent distribution: XXX 
 
* optimizations: 
  - XXX
  - speed up of 5-7 compared to 0.9, overall 2-3 slower than
    CPython 

* Demonstrations of Javascript-Backend / AJAX experiments: 
  XXX play1 pointer? 

* new configuration system: 
  XXX 

* improved documentation: 
  XXX point to main new docs 


What about 1.0? 
======================

In the last days leading up to the release, we decided
to go for naming the release 0.99.0, mainly because
we still have some efforts pending to integrate and complete 
research and coding work: 

* we'd like to get the JIT Compiler Generator to a state where 
  it begings to meet the speed-expectations that many blogs and people 
  out there have chosen as a main criterium for looking at PyPy.

* we are to integrate new Syntax and Aspect-Oriented
  extension capabilities and refine the Logic object 
  space (provides Logic Variables within Python). 

* we'd like to package and improve configurations and 
  and testing, and actually ask for your help
  on getting PyPy to become a sustained and interesting 
  base for further developments

IOW, PyPy 0.99 is the start for getting to 1.0 end of March 2007,
which we intend to become a base for a longer (and more relaxed:) 
time to come.
