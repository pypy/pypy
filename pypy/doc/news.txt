The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

PyPy and Summer of Code 2006
==================================================================

PyPy will again mentor students through Google's `Summer of Code`_
campaign. Three students will kick-off their work on PyPy by
participating in the Duesseldorf sprint. They will be exploring a
back-end for Microsoft.NET, work on ways to build web applications
with Javascript code (in this case by translating RPython to
Javascript) and porting some CPython modules to use ctypes. Welcome to
the team!
