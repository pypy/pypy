    The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
    implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
    description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
    Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
    nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

PyPy Sprint in Paris 10th-16th October 2005 
========================================================

At the moment one of the biggest PyPy sprint ever is taking place: 18 people
are sitting in `Logilabs offices in Paris`_. We are happy to greet five new 
developers to the PyPy Community! Currently we are focusing on implementing
`continuation-passing`_ style (stackless), making the translation process
work for target languages with more powerful object systems and some tiny
steps into the JIT_ direction. Michael and Carl have written
a `report about day one`_. *(10/11/2005)*

PyPy release 0.7.0
=================== 

The first implementation of Python in Python is now also the second
implementation of Python in C :-)

See the `release announcement`_ for further details about the release and
the `getting started`_ document for instructions about downloading it and
trying it out.  We also have the beginning of a FAQ_.  *(08/28/2005)*

PyPy Sprint in Heidelberg 22nd-29th August 2005
==========================================================

The last `PyPy sprint`_ took place at the Heidelberg University
in Germany from 22nd August to 29th August (both days included). 
Its main focus is translation of the whole PyPy interpreter 
to a low level language and reaching 2.4.1 Python compliancy.
The goal of the sprint is to release a first self-contained
PyPy-0.7 version.  Carl has written a report about `day 1 - 3`_, 
there are some pictures_ online and a `heidelberg summary report`_
detailing some of the works that led to the successful release 
of `pypy-0.7.0`_!

PyPy Hildesheim2 finished: first self-contained PyPy run! 
===========================================================

Up until 31st August we were in a PyPy sprint at `Trillke-Gut`_. 
Carl has written a `report about day 1`_, Holger 
about `day 2 and day 3`_ and Carl again about `day 4 and day 5`_, 
On `day 6`_ Holger reports the `breakthrough`_: PyPy runs 
on its own! Hurray_!.  And Carl finally reports about the winding
down of `day 7`_ which saw us relaxing, discussing and generally 
having a good time.   You might want to look at the selected 
`pictures from the sprint`_.

EuroPython 2005 sprints finished 
======================================================

We had two sprints around EuroPython, one more internal core
developer one and a public one.  Both sprints were quite
successful.  Regarding the Pre-EuroPython sprint Michael Hudson 
has posted summaries of `day 1`_, `day 2`_ and `day 3`_ on 
the `pypy-dev`_ mailing list.  The larger public sprint 
has not been summarized yet but it went very well.  We had
20 people initially attending to hear the tutorials and 
work a bit.  Later with around 13-14 people we made the
move to Python-2.4.1, integrated the parser, improved 
the LLVM backends and type inference in general.
