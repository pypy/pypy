PyPy's ctypes implementation document
========================================

* application level code - code written in full python

* interpreter level code - code written in RPython, compiled
  to something else, say C, part of the interpreter.

PyPy's ctypes implementation is right now mostly a proof of concept,
based on the idea of quick prototyping. The main idea was to use libffi
(same as CPython's ctypes implementation), but try to keep as much
code as possible in Python, not RPython. In CPython's situation,
the equivalent would be to write as little as possible code in C.

Low-level part (called \_rawffi)
================================

We implemented direct bindings to libffi in RPython, allowing to create simple
types (arrays, structures), living in C world, managed by hand. It also
supports calling C functions.
This part contains no special code to keep objects alive and is kept very minimal.
We tried to keep this as small as possible to allow porting our ctypes
implementation to other platforms easily. It's also thinkable that Jython uses
our ctypes implementation by writing their version of _rawffi.

High-level part (lib/\_ctypes)
===============================

This part implements the same interface as the \_ctypes module in CPython,
but it's written in full python. This approach allowed us to experiment
quickly and provide a working implementation in 2 months of real time.

Reuse of the highest level (lib/ctypes)
========================================

We just reused the part which is application level in CPython as well.

Ctypes-platform
===============

We released `ctypes-configure`_, which is a package trying to overcome
portability of ctypes-based code.

.. _`ctypes-configure`: http://codespeak.net/~fijal/configure.html

Limitations
===========

* No support for PyXxx functions from libpython, for obvious reasons.

* Subclassing works differently (ie it follows python subclassing scheme
  instead of ctypes subclassing scheme, which does not do
  inheritance)

* It's not supposed to work on other platform than linux

* ...

Speed
=====

Our ctypes implementation was created without putting to much effort into
making it fast. XXX finish improvement part

Running example code
====================

You need a translation with ``--withmod-_rawffi`` in order to run any
ctypes code. For most examples ``--allworkingmodules`` translation option
also makes sense. Known applications to run are `pysqlite-ctypes`_ and
`pyglet`_. As of March 2008, from pysqlite all tests passes except one
that relies on __del__ being called immediately. From pyglet, the following
examples work:
  
  - opengl.py
  - multiple_windows.py
  - events.py
  - window_platform_event.py
  - fixed_resolution.py
  - html_label.py
  - media_player.py
  - timer.py

The following don't work:

  - fixed_resolution.py needs PIL
  - image_convert.py needs PIL
  - image_display.py needs PIL
  - astraea/astraea.py needs PIL
  - video.py (but didn't work for me on CPython either)
  - soundscape needs avbin

The `stress tests`_ of Johnathan Hartley is also working.
