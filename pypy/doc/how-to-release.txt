Making a PyPy Release
=======================

Overview
---------

As a meta rule setting up issues in the tracker for items here may help not forgetting things.
A set of todo files may also work.

Check and prioritize all issues for the release, postpone some if necessary,
create new  issues also as necessary. A meeting (or meetings) should be organized
to decide what things are priorities, should go in and work for the release. 

An important thing is to get the documentation into an up-to-date state!

Release Steps
----------------

* at code freeze make a release branch under http://codepeak.net/svn/pypy/release/x.y(.z) ,
  some of the next updates may be done before or after branching;
  make sure things are ported back to the trunk and to the branch as necessary
* update dist/pypy/doc/contributor.txt (and possibly dist/LICENSE)
* update dist/README
* write release announcement dist/pypy/doc/release-x.y(.z).txt
* update dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.txt links at the top
  and release number references, make sure it is generally up-to-date
* use, after the necessary updates, dist/pypy/tool/makerealase.py to make the tarballs 
  on codespeak (XXX what about tagging the release?)
* nowadays we have an extensive set of nightly builds and test runs. Is probably
  good to do some minimal testing of the tarballs, especially to check that things
  work even outside a working copy or if some stuff is missing.
* write a news item for the release in dist/pypy/doc/news.txt
* send announcements to pypy-dev, pypy-funding, python-list, python-announce, python-dev ...
