Making a PyPy Release
=======================

Overview
---------

As a meta rule setting up issues in the tracker for items here may help not forgetting things.
A set of todo files may also work.

Check and prioritize all issues for the release, postpone some if necessary,
create new  issues also as necessary. A meeting (or meetings) should be organized
to decide what things are priorities, should go in and work for the release. 

An important thing is to get the documentation into an up-to-date state!

Release Steps
----------------

* at code freeze make a release branch under
  http://codepeak.net/svn/pypy/release/x.y(.z). IMPORTANT: bump the
  pypy version number in module/sys/version.py, notice that the branch
  will capture the revision number of this change for the release;
  some of the next updates may be done before or after branching; make
  sure things are ported back to the trunk and to the branch as
  necessary
* update pypy/doc/contributor.txt (and possibly LICENSE)
* update README
* write release announcement pypy/doc/release-x.y(.z).txt
  the release announcement should contain a direct link to the download page
  (which is getting started).
* update pypy/doc/getting-started.txt links at the top
  and release number references, make sure it is generally up-to-date
* use, after the necessary updates, pypy/tool/makerelease.py to
  make the tarballs on codespeak; this generates html doc for the
  tarballs too.  Use::
     
     makerelease -tag .z pypy-x.y.z

  to tag and produce final tarballs. Without the '-tag' this can
  be used to make pre-release testing tarballs.
* nowadays we have an extensive set of nightly builds and test
  runs. Is probably good to do some minimal testing of the tarballs,
  especially to check that things work even outside a working copy or
  if some stuff is missing. We have some support for running part of
  our nightly tests on tarballs (see
  http://codespeak.net/svn/user/pedronis/tarball-testing).
* write a news item for the release in pypy/doc/news.txt
* update http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist and codespeak's
  precomputed html files
* send announcements to pypy-dev, pypy-funding, python-list,
  python-announce, python-dev ...
