=======================
  This Week in PyPy 4
=======================

Introduction
============

This is the fourth of what will hopefully be many summaries of what's
been going on in the world of PyPy in the last week.  I'd still like
to remind people that when something worth summarizing happens to
recommend if for "This Week in PyPy" as mentioned on:

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/weekly/

where you can also find old summaries.

There were about 50 commits to the pypy section of codespeak's
repository since the last summary (not quite a week).


SomePBC-refactoring
===================

We attacked the RTyper quite a lot.


LLVM progress
=============

Richard (nearly?) implemented threading in the LLVM backend.


Sprint preparation
==================

Göteborg approaches.


PyPy spreads
============

Christian consulted in America.


Whither pypy-sync meetings?
===========================

The weekly pypy-sync meeting singularly failed to happen this week.


Resource consumption
====================

As part of being funded, we have to keep track of the resources we use
and have a slightly unusual problem: we haven't spent enough time or
money in the first half of the project, and have to find something to
do about this...
