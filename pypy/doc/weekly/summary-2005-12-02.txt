=======================
  This Week in PyPy 5
=======================

Introduction
============

This is the fifth of what will hopefully be many summaries of what's
been going on in the world of PyPy in the last week.  I'd still like
to remind people that when something worth summarizing happens to
recommend if for "This Week in PyPy" as mentioned on:

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/weekly/

where you can also find old summaries.  I note in passing that the
idea of keeping track of IRC conversations in the weekly summary has
pretty much fizzled.  Oh well.

There were about 230 commits to the pypy section of codespeak's
repository in the last week (a busy one, it seems :-).


SomePBC-refactoring
===================

We merged the branch at last!  Finishing the branch off and getting
translate_pypy running again seemed to mostly involve fighting with
memoized functions and methods, and the "strange details" hinted at in
the last "This Week in PyPy" were not so bad -- indeed once we got to
the point of rtyping finishing, the backend optimizations, source
generation, compilation and resulting binary all worked first time
(there must be something to be said for this Test Driven Development
stuff :).

If you recall from the second This Week in PyPy the thing that
motivated us to start the branch was wanting to support multiple
independent object spaces in the translated binary.  After three weeks
of refactoring we hoped we'd made this possible... and so it proved,
though a couple of small tweaks were needed to the PyPy source.  The
resulting binary is quite a lot (40%) bigger but only a little (10%)
slower.


CCC papers
==========

As mentioned last week, two PyPy talks have been accepted for the
Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin, from December 27th to the
30th.  The CCC asks that speakers provide papers to accompany their
talks (they make a proceedings book) so that's what we've done, and
the results are two quite nice pieces of propaganda for the project:

Btw, it's still possible to attend the CCC conference 27th-30th December 
in Berlin:

A number of PyPy people will be around and innocently mix with
people from other communities and generally be available for 
discussing all things PyPy and the future. 

Where did PyPy-sync go?
=======================

What's a pypy-sync meeting? Apparently::

    It's an XP-style meeting that serves to synchronize
    development work and let everybody know who is 
    working on what.  It also serves as a decision 
    board of the PyPy active developers.  If discussions 
    last too long and decisions cannot be reached 
    they are delegated to a sub-group or get postponed. 

pypy-sync meetings usually happen on thursdays at 1pm CET on the 
#pypy-sync IRC channel on freenode, and they are usually 
prepared an Agenda and minutes after the meeting.  Except that 
the last couple haven't really happened this way -- no agenda, 
a few people have turned up, but not many and mostly it's just the
people who are in #pypy all week anyway.

So after the Gtbg sprint next week we're going to try harder
to prepare and get developers to attend pypy-sync meetings
again.  This is especially important as we head towards
JIT-compiler efforts, integrating more of our GC works, more
and refined backends and lots of other challenges.
