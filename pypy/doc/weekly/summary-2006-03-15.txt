=======================
  This Week in PyPy X
=======================

Introduction
============

If a week can be a long time in politics, it can be even longer in
open source documentation... it seems that writing one summary a week
isn't really sustainable, so we're going to try to scale back to an
activity report every two weeks or so.  This report covers roughly the
last month of development.

PyCon
=====

The end of February was naturally dominated by PyCon in Texas which
was attended by several core developers.  We gave three well-received
talks, talked to a great many interested people and held a successful
sprint, giving several newcomers their first taste of hacking on PyPy.

You can read more about this in the `conference report`_ and `sprint
report`_.

The Logic Sprint
================

Last week there was a PyPy-sprint at the UCL in Louvain-la-Neuve. Its main
topic was logic and constraint programming in PyPy. Two of the sprint days were
devoted to discussions with some researchers at the UCL who are heavily
involved with the Oz programming language. The discussions were fruitful and
very stimulating. For more details see the `logic sprint report`_

The Logic Object Space
-----------------------

One of the more visible results of the sprint is the Logic Object Space, a very
small (in terms of lines of code) object space that implements dataflow
variables similar to what Oz has in Python. XXX more

Garbage Collection
==================

This week Michael with the help of Carl, Samuele and Armin managed for
the first time to compile the pypy interpreter together with our own
garbage collector written in Python.  Performance is not that great as
yet, about 100 times slower than CPython or about 16 times slower than
with the Boehm collector.  Given that we haven't tuned our garbage
collector for performance at all, this isn't too bad.

This required quite a bit of work and first we refactored the way the
existing two garbage collectors (reference counting and using the Boehm
collector) are implemented in the C backend. Before, they were
implemented by inserting C code into appropriate places in the generated
code using string formatting. This had several disadvantages:
%-formatting C code is obviously not helpful for other backends, and it
makes writing code that reasons about the GC operations really very
hard.  We rewrote this to use a "GCTransformer" to instead insert new
operations into the graphs that have equivalent functionality. 

We wrote two transfomers that re-implemented the reference counting and
Boehm policies, and a new "FrameworkGCTransformer" that inserts calls to
functions defined by one of the garbage collectors written by Carl for
his Summer of Code project.  The final piece of the puzzle was a
solution to the perennial "finding roots" problem, where we went for the
exceedingly ugly and inefficient approach of keeping our own stack of
root pointers.

And then we banged our heads against the usual obscure bugs and
finally made it work.  It turns out that debugging C that's generated
Python code that manipulates memory addresses directly is hard on the
brain... we need to get back to being able to run everything on the
memory simulator.

JIT Status
==========

The JIT did not progress much recently.  Nevertheless, it seems useful
to try to give an overview of the current situation and where we are
going next.

Our current "state of the art" in the area is represented by
``pypy.jit.test.test_hint_timeshift.test_arith_plus_minus()``.  It is a
really tiny interpreter which gets turned into a compiler.
There is a very draftish description of what is going on in:

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/jit.html

Current areas of work:

* the hint-rtyping actually produces a lot of bookkeeping code; we will
  have to reduce this amount in the future.  More worryingly, it doesn't
  handle calls at all at the moment.  We need to rethink and document
  how exactly the code the hint-rtyper produces should look like before
  we can start working in this direction.

* in the last few days, Samuele and Arre worked on virtual structures
  (blue variables) for the hint-rtyper.  Together with Armin they fixed
  some remaining bugs in the hint-annotator.  Hint-rtyper support is
  still very preliminary and already hitting some head-scratching
  questions.
