PyPy - Overview over the EU-reports
============================================


We have written several reports for the EU of which some are also quite useful
as documentation. The ones not so useful as documentation mostly contain text
that can also be found in the regular documentation section. All these
documents are not approved by the European Union and therefore only
preliminary.

Reports of 2006
===============

`Draft D07.1 Massive Parallelism and Translation Aspects`_ is an interim
version of a report about PyPy's optimization efforts, garbage collectors and
massive parallelism (stackless) features. The report is not complete
(especially the stackless part is still missing), all feedback to it is
extremely welcome!


Reports of 2005
===============

`D04.1 Partial Python Implementation`_ contains details about the 0.6 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D04.2 Complete Python Implementation`_ contains details about the 0.7 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D04.3 Parser and Bytecode Compiler`_ describes our parser and bytecode compiler.

`D04.4 PyPy as a Research Tool`_ contains details about the 0.8 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D05.1 Compiling Dynamic Language Implementations`_ is a paper that describes
the translation process, especially the flow object space and the annotator in
detail.

`D05.2 A Compiled Version of PyPy`_ contains more details about the 0.7 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D05.3 Implementation with Translation Aspects`_
describes how our approach hides away a lot of low level details.

`D05.4 Encapsulating Low Level Aspects`_ describes how we weave different
properties into our interpreter during the translation process.

`D14.1 Report about Milestone/Phase 1`_ describes what happened in the PyPy
project during the first year of EU funding (December 2004 - December 2005)
