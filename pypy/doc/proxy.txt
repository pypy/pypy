PyPy - transparent proxy implementation
=======================================

Among the unique features of PyPy, there is as well possibility of
having multiple implementations of builtin types. Multiple performance
optimisations using this features are already implemented, some 
hints are in `Object space`_ document.

Transparent proxy is implementation of some (maybe all at some point)
of objects like functions, objects, lists etc. which forwards all
operations performed on object to app-level function with specific
signature.

.. _`Object space`: objspace.html#object-types

Example:
========

Suppose we want to have list which stores all operations performed on
it for later analysis. So we create a list an apropriate controller::

 from pypymagic import transparent_proxy

 class Controller(object):
     def __init__(self, l):
         self.l = l
         self.history = []
     def perform(self, name, *args, **kwargs):
         self.history.append(name)
         return getattr(self.l, name)(*args, **kwargs)
 l = []
 c = Controller(l)
 lst = transparent_proxy(list, c.perform)

Here, we've created original list, some random class and called magic
``transparent_proxy`` function, which eats operation name and additional 
arguments.
Important bit is that we do not need some existing object to perform
operations on, it can do whatever we like. And of course 
``type(lst) is type(l)`` and ``lst is not l`` (well, the latter is not
"of course", but actually it's true).

Now we can access all history of operations on ``c.history``, if we
perform something like::

 lst.append(3)
 print lst
 lst[:-1]

it'll be something like ``['__getattribute__', '__repr__', '__getitem__']``
(not that ``append`` is just an argument to ``__getattribute__``).

Further points of interest:
===========================

A lot of tasks could be performed using transparent proxies. Including,
but not limited to:

* Remote version of objects, on which we perform operations
  (think about transparent distribution)

* Access to some persistent-storages like databases (imagine
  SQL object mapper which looks like real object)

* Access to external data structures, like other languages as normal
  objects. (Of course some will raise exceptions, but it's purely done
  in application level, so it's not real problem)

Random notes:
=============

Transparent proxy is implemented on top of `standart object space`_, in
`proxy_helpers.py`_, `proxyobject.py`_ and `transparent.py`_. To run it
you need to pass ``--with-transparent-proxy`` option to ``py.py`` or
``translate.py``. It registers implementations like a ``W_TransparentXxx``
which usually corresponds to an apropriate ``W_XxxObject``, including some
interpreter hacks for objects that are too involved into interpreter
tricks to be implemented in a std objspace. Actually working objects are:
user created classes & functions, lists, dicts, exceptions, tracebacks and
frames.
