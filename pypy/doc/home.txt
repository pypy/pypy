The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

Getting into PyPy ... 
=============================================

* `PyPy blog`_ for news and status blog about PyPy developments 

* `development mailing list`_ for conceptual and coding discussions 

* `subversion commit mailing list`_ for all updates to code and
  documentation. 

* `development bug/feature tracker`_ for filing bugs and feature requests. 

* `sprint mailing list`_ for people (interested in) attending upcoming sprints. 

* **IRC channel #pypy on freenode**: Many of the core developers are hanging out 
  at #pypy on irc.freenode.net.  You are welcome to join and ask questions even more 
  so if you are interested in participating in some parts of the PyPy project. You 
  can find the logs of the channel here_.


Meeting PyPy developers
=======================

The PyPy developers are organising sprints and presenting results at
conferences all year round. They will be happy to meet in person with
anyone interested in the project.  Watch out for sprint announcements.
