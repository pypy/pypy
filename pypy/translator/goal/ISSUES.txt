Known RTyper issues
-------------------

Let's list and update here the issues that will show up, or have shown up
already sometime ago, while running translate_pypy::

  * FlotRepr abs

  * slice(SomeObject, SomeObject, SomeObject)

  * the PBCReprs generally lack a convert_from_to() to convert from a small PBC
    set to a larger one.

  * how to implement the three overrides of translator/ann_override.py ?

  * the pypy trunk is still not annotable:
     - see issue92 about parser typing problems

How to work in parallel:
There is an environment variable to be set with your personal random seed.
Seeds taken so far are
Armin: 42, Samuele: 46, Chris: 49, Arre: 97
Under Windows, use
SET RTYPERSEED=xx
where xx is your seed. When you run translate_pypy, you will get a message
with your seed, if everything is fine. The purpose of the seed is to
shuffle the annotated blocks, in order to create different errors.
