TODO for mering numpy-dtype-alt
===============================

* Fix sin(<bool array>)
* Fix for raw memory with the JIT under llgraph.
* More operations on more dtypes
* Any more attributes that need to be exposed at app-level

For later
=========

* More APIs need dtype arguments (zeros, ones, etc.)
