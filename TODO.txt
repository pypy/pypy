==================================

- why do we need to implement array.nonzero on this branch and it was not done
  e.g. on default?

TODO list by mattip
===================

- test "from numpypy import *" esp. get_include()
- test all *.h files under pypy/module/cpyext/include/numpy
- make sure meaningful cpyext changes are tested:
    all ndarrayobject.c
    copy_header_files() in api.py (changed)
    all ndarrayobject.py (new)
    PyNumber_CoerceEx() (new)
    PyNumber_Coerce() (new)
- test, implement use of __array_prepare__()
- test, implement use of __array_wrap__()
