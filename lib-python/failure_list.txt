test_cpickle
    has been re-run, still failing

test_descr
    cannot easily complete this; after another quick review, the failures
    left are mostly "don't care" internal details.

test_builtin
    (some of these might have been fixed by now:)
    - our compilers need to recognize BOM markers
    - eval etc  should accept dict subclasses
    - hex/oct should output '-' for negative numbers
    - FIXED unicode("\u0663", 'raw-unicode-escape') does not work properly
    - disallow interning of string subclasses
    - __future__ import division problems

test_extcall
   cannot be fixed.  PyPy produces different TypeError messages but they are
   also correct and useful (reviewed them again).

test_codecscallback
    Should be fixed by now, takes a long time to re-run

test_compiler 
    not a core mode

test_global
    should be run and pass with --compiler=pyparseapp

test_codeop
    could be fixed, maybe (being worked on)

test_compile
    - test_exec_with_general_mapping_for_locals has been modified to expect
      a NameError for global lookup failure with a non standard dictionnary
      PyPy doesn't translate KeyError to NameError for the global case but it
      does it correctly for local
    - test_for_distinct_code_objects works with pypy on top of python2.4 but not
      on top of python2.3 this is because code objects differing only
      by line number are equal on 2.3 and different on 2.4. This test is not worth
      fixing. Pypy's own PyCode objects behave correctly and this is what we use both
      for _stable and ast compilers
    - test_unary_minus fails on top of 2.3 with stable compiler because it uses c-python eval
      and the tests checks that eval("0xffffffff") returns 2*MAXINT and not -1

test_generators
    all tests that do not depend on weakrefs pass
    
test_traceback
    - test_caret : fails because we don't include line text into the syntax error. needs a bit of
      refactoring of the link between parser and transformer to make it work
    - test_nocaret : it's testing an obscure case that basicaly returns a syntax error with 3 parameters (no positional info)
                     it even as a special if not_jython to pass on jython

test_future
    to be investigated...
    
test_genexps
    three failures because of different error messages along the lines of:
       'can't assign to genexpr' instead of 'assignement to genexpr ...'
       'division by zero' instead of 'division or modulo by zero'
    the other failures are due to missing weakref support
    
test_trace
    Fails because of our compiler generating different linenumber information
    than CPythons.
