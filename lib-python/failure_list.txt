    fails because  "dict.__repr__ is dict.__repr__" equals False

test_import 
    fails because os.open is case insensitive (at least on Mac os X)

multiple tests fail because from __future__ import division does 
not work (true division is never enabled)

    fails because len is not implemented for SeqIter (and
    other structures like generators (reversed) )

test_compiler 
    fails because of "maximum recursion depth exceeded"

test_decorator
    fails because globals and locals are None in a nested function ?


test_builtin
    - our compilers need to recognize BOM markers
    - eval etc  should accept dict subclasses
    - hex/oct should output '-' for negative numbers
    - unicode("\u0663", 'raw-unicode-escape') does not work properly
      (nik is working on this)
    - disallow interning of string subclasses
    - __future__ import division problems
